Discuss the following passage from Act 1 Scene 1 of The Tempest, exploring Shakespeare's use of language and its dramatic effects. [15 marks]

On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning is heard. Enter a SHIPMASTER, and a BOATSWAIN [and MARINERS].[Enter a Master and a Boatswain]
Master. Boatswain!
Boatswain. Here, master: what cheer?
Master. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. 
[Exit] 
Boatswain. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!                                                                5
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,]
GONZALO, and others]
Alonso. Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.
Boatswain. I pray now, keep below.
Antonio. Where is the master, boatswain?
Boatswain. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.
Gonzalo. Nay, good, be patient.
Boatswain. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin:                  10                          silence! trouble us not.
Gonzalo. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Boatswain. None that I more love than myself. You are a councillor; if you can command these                          elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your                             authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin              15                     for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out of our way, I say. [Exit]
Gonzalo. I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;                                       his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging: make the rope of his destiny                             our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is                                           miserable. [Exit.]                                                                                                                                             20
[Re-enter Boatswain]
Boatswain. Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course.
[A cry within]
[Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather or our office. [To the lords.] Yet again?                                What do you here? Shall we give o'er and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
Sebastian. A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
Boatswain. Work you then.                                                                                                                          25
Antonio. Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be                                   drowned than thou art.
Gonzalo. I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell                                                 and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
Boatswain. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off.                                     30
[Enter Mariners wet]
Mariners. All lost! To prayers, to prayers! all lost!
Boatswain. What, must our mouths be cold?
Gonzalo. The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.
Sebastian.                     I'm out of patience.
Antonio. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:                                                                           35
This wide-chapp'd rascal-would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
Gonzalo.                         He'll be hanged yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.
[A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-]
'We split, we split!'-'Farewell, my wife and children!'-                                                                                 40
'Farewell, brother!'-'We split, we split, we split!'
Antonio. Let's all sink with the king.
Sebastian.                                         Let's take leave of him.
[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]
Gonzalo. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath,                            brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a dry death.
[Exeunt]

I think that the most shocking aspect of this scene for Shakespeare's audience when the play was first performed in 1611 would have been the way in which the mariners - mere underlings - address the aristocratic characters on the ship.
                          Alonso. ...Where's the master? Play the men.
                                Boatswain. I pray now, keep below.
                                Antonio. Where is the master, boatswain?
                                Boatswain. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your              cabins: you do assist the storm.
                            (The Tempest, I.i.6-9)
Exchanges like this would, I think, have demonstrated to the audience the extent to which the first scene of the play turns the world upside down: amidst the storm, the rules that are normally taken to govern early modern social relations are set aside - courtly conventions and the established social hierarchy give way before the fact that the mariners have an expertise that the Italian aristocrats lack. This means that the Great Chain of Being is effectively subverted and undermined. In extremis, self-preservation seems to be the only principle that matters - this is beautifully captured in the words exchanged between Gonzalo, the "honest old councillor", and the Boatswain:

                                    Gonzalo. ...remember whom thou hast aboard.
                                    Boatswain. None that I more love than myself.  
                              (The Tempest, I.i.12-13)

It is important, then, that the actors playing the aristocrats and their courtiers express outrage amidst their terror at their predicament in this scene. Antonio and Sebastian railing against the mariners reveals their cynical, grievance-filled attitude to the world (a fact testified to by the fact that curses and insults seem their natural mode), but it is also a function of their surprise that the social rules that they had assumed would govern behaviour on the ship prove so fragile - it would be helpful if this idea was conveyed in performance through a genuine sense of astonishment on the part of those who consider themselves socially superior and who are, suddenly, not being obeyed by their social inferiors in the tempest.    

The Tempest is a play that concerns itself with the nature of theatrical artifice and it is apt, therefore, that all is not as it seems in the play's first, dramatic scene. The storm that we - and the characters involved - take so seriously is, in fact, mere artifice - a scene in a play crafted by Prospero. (This meta-theatrical element in the play is taken particularly seriously in Peter Greenaway's film version of the play, Prospero's Books, where the identification between Prospero and Shakespeare underpins the whole production.) Prospero assures his daughter, Miranda, in the next scene that "There's no harm done" (I.ii.15). So the high-stakes, heart-in-mouth scene that we witness on stage is profoundly misleading. The desperate words of the characters convey a sense of their lives being at stake - significantly, the majority of lines in this scene seem to be imperatives (the Boatswain's "...Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off..." is a characteristic utterance) - but in actual fact the Prospero-inspired storm is - like dramatic performance itself - a mere passing show.   

Yet Shakespeare does everything he possibly can in this scene to ensure that the audience invests emotionally in the action. While the early modern theatre would have lacked the technical means of the modern stage, the situation depicted would have had the highest conceivable stakes for Shakespeare's audience. Sea travel would have been more prevalent and much more hazardous in the 17th century and the world of early modern publishing was full of pamphlets like that which inspired the play (the account of the shipwreck written by William Strachey in 1610 is thought to be the primary source for the play). Shakespeare's use of the language of navigation and seamanship ("topsail", "topmast", "main course", "lay her off") is drawn directly from contemporary pamphlets and every available linguistic and dramatic resource is made to make the audience feel the quality of the storm: characters speak across one another: the imagery of water dominates ("these roarers"; "the washing of ten tides"; "every drop of water"); and the sense of impending disaster is always uppermost in the audience's minds ("We split, we split!-Farewell, my wife and children!-/Farewell, brother!-We split, we split, we split!"). Ideally, we should watch the first scene in the same way that Miranda watches it: she reveals in the next scene that she has 
                                                                  ...suffered
                With those that I saw suffer! [seeing] A brave vessel,
                Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,
                Dashed all to pieces...   
                (The Tempest, I.ii.5-8)

While the audience might be a little more sceptical than Miranda regarding the nobility of those on board the boat, we should watch this short, highly dramatic scene that throws us in medias res into the world of The Tempest exactly as Miranda does - rapt, totally engaged, astonished at the power of nature that is revealed, in actual fact, to be the power of theatrical artifice.
