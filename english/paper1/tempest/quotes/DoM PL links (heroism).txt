Death's harbinger: sad task, yet argument
Not less but more heroic then the wrath
Of stern Achilles..."

Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and nature from her seat
Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe,

Must pull down heaven upon me..."

My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
Our state cannot be severed, we are one,
One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself."

'Tis not the figure cut in alabaster
Kneels at my husband's tomb."
