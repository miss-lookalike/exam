"Seeing death as the beginning rather than the end - this is the biggest difference between the Literature of the past and that of today."
In the light of this view, consider way in which writers represent death in one drama text and one poetry text from the above lists.	
"...Here's a hand 
	[Gives her a dead man's hand.]
To which you have vow'd much love..."
(Ferdinand DoM: IV.ii.41-42)

"...Sin and her shadow death, and misery,           Death's harbinger..."  (PL.IX.12-13)                                              

 "...Her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
That all was lost." ." (PL: IX.780-784)


                       "...And now I pray, let me 
Be laid by and never thought of.   [Dies]"
(Cardinal, DoM: V.v.87-88) 

                        ....so as we need not fear                                         To pass commodiously this life, sustained              By him with many comforts, till we end                 In dust, our final rest and native home.               What better can we do, than, to the place                Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall     Before him reverent... (PL: X.1082-1088)
Pull, and pull strongly, for your able strength          Must pull down heaven upon me...                 (Duchess, DoM: IV.ii.87-88)
