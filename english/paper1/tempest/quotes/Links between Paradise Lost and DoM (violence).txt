"Violence always fascinates as much as it repels."
In the light of this view, consider ways in which writers depict violence in one drama text and one poetry text from the above lists.	
Ferdinand.       ...Here's a hand,
To which you have vowed much love. The ring upon't
You gave. (Gives her a dead man's hand.)
Duchess. I affectionately kiss it.
(DoM: IV.i.42-44)

...Her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
That all was lost." (PL: IX.780-784)

If all my royal kindred
Lay in my way unto this marriage,
I'd make them my low footsteps: and even now,
Even in this hate, as men in some great battles,
By apprehending danger, have achieved
Almost impossible actions (I have heard soldiers say     so),
So I through frights and threatenings will assay
This dangerous venture...
(Duchess DoM: I.ii.256-263)

Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
And of their vain contest appeared no end.
(PL.IX.1187-1189) 

Bosola.             Where's the waiting-woman?
Fetch her. Some other strangle the children.
(DoM IV.ii.229-230)

Cardinal. Come I will swear you to't upon this book.
[Holds up a Bible.]
Julia. Most religiously. 
Cardinal.                    Kiss it.
[She kisses the Bible.]
Now you shall never utter it. Thy curiosity 
Hath undone thee: thou'rt poisoned with that book.
(DoM V.ii.260-263)
