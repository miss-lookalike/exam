"I am Duchess of Malfi still." 
(Duchess DoM: IV.ii.137)

"...Her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
That all was lost." ." (PL: IX.780-784)

"...Give me some wet hay; I am broken-winded.
I do account this world but a dog-kennel.
(Ferdinand: DoM, V.v.64-65)
"...Thus they in mutual accusation spent                             
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
And of their vain contest appeared no end."
(PL: IX.1188-1189)
                                "...both confessed
Humbly their faults, and pardon begged, with tears
Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
(PL: X.1100-1104)

                       "...And now I pray, let me 
Be laid by and never thought of.   [Dies]"
(Cardinal, DoM: V.v.87-88)
