##### What is sin? 

- Corrupt behaviour. Goes against religious beliefs about what is morally good. 
- Immoral act which goes against Divine law. 
- An action which separates humans from God. 
- Therefore, for an Early Modern person, it is terrible… a barrier to heaven. 

##### How has view of sin changed? 

- Less an action which separates us from God… has become an immoral action in general. 
- Atheists and agnostics can still sin, but not in the eyes of God. 
- The word sin is rooted in religion. A sin today is an action prohibited by bible / church… less emphasis on separation from God. 
- There are no ‘sins’. Human behaviour is motivated by context / need. All behaviours can, at some level, be empathised with. People require care, not judgement. 
- Aquinas' doctrine of double effect, Aristotle's ideas of a Phronimos knowing what to do, Fletcher's doctrine of love, 
- View of sin has changed through time. A more open definition today. Esp. true with sexual morality. (Or depends on your place in society e.g. James I’s bisexuality).

##### Who sins in Paradise Lost?

- Eve eating the apple 
- Adam eating the apple
- E + A - lusting afterwards 
- Satan

##### Who sins in Malfi?

Cardinal, Ferdinand, Bosola. In C17th Duchess sins – amalgamating social classes, disobeys brothers, ALL of them are Roman Catholics, Antonio (also willing to mix classes) and to behave duplicitously, Julia, Cariola (lies / conceals D’s relationship).

##### The wages of sin (are death) Are the consequences of sin just? 

A & E – is an infinite punishment ever just for a finite sin? If E ate the apple, she would have got away with her sin for eternity (so she needed this punishment). 

The D’s punishment is unjust. There was no crime. Dromgoole – the D’s and A marriage is lit as the moral centre of the play – therefore she was wrongly killed. F regrets the murder afterwards.
