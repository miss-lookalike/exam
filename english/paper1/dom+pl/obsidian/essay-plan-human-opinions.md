>[!Title]+
>'Differences of opinion are unavoidable in human societies'.
In the light of this view, consider the ways in which writers explore clashes of opinion.

---

- Eve vs Adam in the garden - garden alone or together - relates to Areopagatica and Milton vs the Monarchy 
- Satan vs God - could also represent monarchy vs people

- Ferdinand and the Cardinal remarriage / must marry for status vs the Duchess marrying for love and suffering for that 
- Is morality opinion because the Duchesses unwavering morality and commitment to love and family brought about her death
- Bosola does not really have "opinions" or at least he does not express them in the play he instead acts on the whims of his payers until the end of the play where he enacts his revenge on everyone


- DOM is also fundamentally about the corruption and secrecy of courts - fountain metaphor at the beginning from Antonio which is a difference in opinion to the society of monarchy and this would bring about conflict
- Bosola is in opposition to this and this causes conflict - ‘rails against what he wants most’
- Modern audiences will have conflict with the corruption too

- Societal opinion vs personal - Eve wants to be equal but is supposed to be inferior and A+D marriage is looked down upon

# Argument

![[essay-plan-human-opinions#^5088e6]]

- PL - A+E argue
- DOM - D+A do not 
- argument between relationship may not be necessary

- PL - differences in opinion is further proliferated by exterior sources
- DOM - Ferdinand + Cardinal opinion difference with Duchess is unavoidable - she marries for love not status 

## Should we avoid differences in opinion

- Milton fundamentally supports differences in opinion
- Lanyer - contemporary opinions on the fall
- Healthy vs Unhealthy opinions


## Perhaps society makes it unavoidable:

- DOM - Bosola is in fundamental opposition to the high class court setting of it - Modern audience may not understand this fully but an early modern one will as they were under James I 
- Perhaps in a corrupt society there will always be differences

- Even in perfect Eden there is differences so perhaps it is truly unavoidable

# Structure

- Could be done by healthiness of opinions
- Since Milton fundamentally agrees difference is good it could be better to talk about the healthiness/productiveness of the differences
