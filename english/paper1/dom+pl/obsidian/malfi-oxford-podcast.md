***

Almost versions of this story before the DoM were moralistic. 

- Thomas Beard 1597 *Whoredoms committed under colours of marriage* argued that Antonio and Duchess were not married and were just fornicating. Argued protestant God used catholic cardinal despite his catholic status. 
- William Painter's *The Palace of Pleasure* blamed A + D again and presented D as stereotypical lusty widow. Sexual desire is D's sin and ambition is A's. "We ought never to climb higher than our force permiteth"

Webster works to complicate / sympathise with characters. Webster is either sympathetic or apathetic to all of his characters and treats them with an equidistance. 

Duchess is both sympathetic and not:

- Lies to her brothers 
- Wastes soliloquy before meeting with her brothers on general issues instead of trying to make the audience sympathise
	- In King Lear Cordelia uses an aside early in the play to garner sympathy - momentary clearing of a busy stage is a cue to get closer to character
- Never know her name 

- Likeable domestic scene between Cariola and her joking breaks cold behaviour of her brothers
- Her death is a stoic set piece - "I am Duchess of Malfi still" - breaks the idea of a lusty widow

The plays inconsistencies may be more attributed to Jacobean society than mistakes in Webster's crafting. 

- No reason she is so interested with Antonio
- No reason brothers are so against Antonio
- Incest context - Bell Imperia and Lorenza in *the Spanish tragedy*, Giovanni and Anabella in *Tis Pity she is Whore*

Less interested in blame but more in consequences. Ring symbolises many thing: winner of tilting competition, marriage, hangman's noose, musculature of a vagina in early modern time - play does not / cannot avoid this.

*The Winters Tale* - Perditer is a sign that tragedy will not be the end of the play. The D's children symbol a way around tragedy trying to allude the plays narrative structure. 

George Henry Lewis (partner of George Elliot) - "Instead of holding the mirror up to nature (hamlet) this drama holds the mirror up to Madame Tussauds" - criticism based upon realist theatre highbrow of Shakespeare vs lowbrow of Webster

> Here is discovered, behind a traverse,[99] the artificial figures of ANTONIO and his children, appearing as if they were dead.

"Artificial" and "appearing" make it difficult to understand what is meant to be interpreted. Wax work was often used earlier now it is more common to use actors. Antonio's death here almost foreshadows his ultimate demise. 

Despite Bosola's wish to do right by Antonio he is trapped by the pressure of the genre, the pressure of the sources, the world which the play is in and Webster's pessimistic view. 

By comparing real people to waxworks we view how actors can be used to portray specific feelings and emotions much like real waxworks. One of its themes is how social highers can subdue their unders. Te atrum mundi - "all men have been of his occupation (actor) and indeed what he doth feignedly that do others essentially" - everyone pretends to be something they are not and plays roles. Theatre should not be like the world the world should be like theatre.  ^c8757d

> MALATESTI.       Thou wretched thing of blood,
> How came Antonio by his death?
> 
> BOSOLA.  In a mist; I know not how:
> Such a mistake as I have often seen
> In a play.

Casts play in an absurdist frame. Bosola's ability to place himself out of situations is here turned on the play. He has a 1/3 more lines than the Duchess. Combination of John Donne and Iago - metaphysical language e.g. geometry simile. Smith here mentions the poem "[A Valediction: Forbidden Mourning](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44131/a-valediction-forbidding-mourning)", presents love as sacred and matches Bosola's crutches/geometry simile. Metaphor's of metaphysical poets are called "conceits". He is a malcontent, educated man without preferment. He is a made up figure by Webster. He bridges different worlds in the play. He is incompatible with the previous moralising of the play. He represents class anxiety. He is the ultimate ambivalence to the story of the play. Duchess disappears from the last act leaving the play to feel "stilted" and she doesn't have the most lines or best lines either - those are both Bosola's. 

Jacobean tragedy is sceptical - questioning, a radical ambivalence, inability and avoidance of tragedy and preaching and avoidance of a message. T.S. Elliot - "Webster saw the skull beneath the skin". Duchess of Malfi is a social autopsy of familial, religious and emotional corruption.

> "Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust,
> Like diamonds, we are cut with our own dust."

Ready for "commonplacing" putting quotes under ready headings in a common place book. This is why there is quotes. Heading towards a nodding non-narrative direction. Webster denies us an illusion of real people on the stage.

Plays inhumanity is its most compelling feature. During the 19th century it was unliked. First successful was in London in 1945: John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft. Times wrote it as "utterly compelling" "play found it moment". Printed near photos of the first death camps being printed in the times.
