How does love impact the plot ant outcome for the characters?:
- [[The Duchess of Malfi]] - plot is driven by A and D's love for one another
- [[Paradise Lost books IX-X|pl-moc]] - the fall of Adam happens because of his love for Eve
- DOM – F’s incestuous desires for D drive her away. 
- In PL, S’s lust for Eve fuels her fall. 
- In PL, Eve’s love and desire for indep. Drives a wedge between her and Adam. 
- In both texts, love results in the deaths of their protagonists.  

3.How far is love presented by these writers as: 
a) Destructive 
b) Essential? 

- In DOM, love is presented as both a) and b). B admires A’s and D’s romantic love (it is essential, but it does kill them.) 
- In PL, it is more destructive than essential. 

In DOM love is a revolutionary force, capable of reforming society. In PL, it lacks purpose? A and E will not die. They do not require children.

##### Topic sentences

- Both Milton and Webster present inappropriate obsessions that are unreciprocated between characters.
- In both PL and DOM Love is presented at times in the form of Agapeic self-sacrifice. (Adam eating apple and Duchess sacrificing herself stoically - e.g. The good Samaritan - Luke 10:25-37, The woman caught in adultery - John 8:1-11)

- Milton and Webster present love as a destructive force which tears down the innocence and joy between two lovers.

- Through religious influences on both texts, there is a strong distinction between love and lust.

Through religious influences on both texts, there is a strong distinction between love and lust. In the Duchess of Malfi, Antonio and the Duchesses' love is compared to the "spheres, still in motion" which is a direct comparison of the love between these two characters to the divine. Antonio later decides to try and talk with the Cardinal despite his immoral treatment of the Duchess and this is also a great risk to Antonio but does it out of a pure love. Antonio's death casts this in a self sacrificial light and it ends up with his child becoming the new duke of Malfi. This could be compared to Mark 15:21-41 where Jesus sacrifices himself for God's children chance to live. While Antonio did not have foresight of his death he was still taking a large risk by coming out of hiding that can only be put up to a form of pure and self sacrificial Agapeic love. This could also be compared to John 8:1-11 where the woman was caught in adultery and Jesus chose to forgive her out of Agapeic love. Antonio chooses to forgive the undeserving Cardinal and this ultimately leads to his downfall. Julia is a character who is solely filled with lustful Eros love. She is in a lustful and sinful relationship on the cardinal using the guise of visiting an anchoress to escape her husband. Her love is also shown to be fickle and changing. Bosola describes her as "lustful Julia"
