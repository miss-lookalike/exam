'During the sixteenth century Englishwomen found voices through the contradictory injunctions Protestantism, which on the one hand reasserted the traditional expectation of womanly silence and subservience, but on the other hand affirmed the supremacy of individual conscience, even in women, to whom God could speak directly and, in theory, allow exceptions to the general rule of silence. So the very popular Protestant tract, A Godlie Forme of Householde Government (1598), allows a wife some authority over children and servants but demands full obedience to her husband, to whom she must be 'dutitifull, faithfull, and loving,' and silent if she disagrees with him. Yet women were increasingly free to translate religious works and write of their own religious experience, even to the extent producing religious verse'
