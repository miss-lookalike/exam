from Aemilia Lanyer, 'Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum' (1611)

Till now your indiscretion sets us free, 
And makes our former fault much lesse appeare;
Our mother Eve, who tasted of the Tree, 
Giving to Adam what shee held most deare 
Was simply good, and had no power to see,
The after-comming harme did not appeare: 
       The subtle Serpent that our Sex betraide, 
       Before our fall so sure a plot had laide.

That undiscerning Ignorance perceav'd 
No guile, or craft that was by him intended:
For had she knowne, of what we were bereav'd,
To his request she had not condiscended.
But she (poor soule) by cunning was deceav'd,
No hurt therein her harmelesse Heart intended:
       For she alleadg'd Gods word, which he denies,
       That they should die, but even as Gods, be wise.
        
But surely Adam can not be excusde, 
Her fault though great, yet hee was most too blame; 
What Weaknesse offerd, Strength might have refusde,
Being Lord of all, the greater was his shame:
