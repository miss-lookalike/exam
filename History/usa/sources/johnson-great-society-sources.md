> Almost all of the Great Society programs (the exceptions are the civil-rights laws) range from unsuccessful to counter-productive. The number of the poor did decline by a quarter between 1965 and 1970. Without any doubt the Great Society programs accounted for some of this but the Social Security program established by the New Deal accounted for more and there were other people whose increase of income was due to the natural growth of the economy. On the whole, poverty seems to have decreased at a slower rate in the 1960s than before. The principal factors affecting the rate of movement out of poverty are not the good intentions of legislators or the generosity of taxpayers: rather they are changes in the composition of the population and in the size of the gross national product. It is reasonable to expect that, by 1980, no one will be below the existing poverty line. This would be the case, no doubt, even if the War on Poverty had never been declared

> In the period we are about to enter, those programs which are strongest – because they do most for the prosperous and least for Negroes and the poor generally – will become increasingly consolidated. As usual the prosperous will come to appreciate just how easily social spending can be converted to the advantage of those who need it least. Possibly Mr Johnson went just about as far as a conservative politician in a conservative, racist country could have gone. The Great Society has distributed the nation's income even less equally than it was distributed before 1960. It has enlarged the prestige and influence of the business community. It has lost its fights with racism and poverty. The Great Society has ground to a halt far short of a massive attack on urban problems, far short of the full integration of Negroes into American society, and far short of a genuine assault upon poverty and deprivation. These are the unfulfilled aims of a true effort to realize a Great Society

- Chicago campaign - de facto segregation 
- 1967 - seems premature to give this judgement on the GS
- Reflects division on the left + conservative backlash 
- 50.3 billion on GS, 120 billion on vietnam
- Challenge/limit (liberal time)
- Validate 'lost its fight with racism and poverty'

> Did the Great Society fail? No. The Great Society wasn't totally successful; government was guilty of promising more than it could deliver. But acknowledging its shortcomings is quite a different thing from dismissing the programs as outright failures. The truth is that the poor have benefitted; and that, for the first time since the New Deal, the direction of social policy has been determined by a commitment to the principle of equality. What brought about the gap between promise and performance? I think there were three fundamental weaknesses in the strategy. First, the objectives were short-sighted, with an emphasis on providing services rather than more ambitious and permanent goals, such as a guaranteed annual income for the poor. Second, the administration tried to correct the political powerlessness of minorities, at the expense of attacking the economic roots of inequality. Finally, a most serious weakness was the enormous under-financing of the majority of programs.
