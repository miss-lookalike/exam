To what extent were the presidencies of Ford & Carter disastrous for the USA at home and abroad? [25] 

During the presidencies of Ford (1974-77) and Carter (1977-81), there were more disasters abroad, but these frequently had large ripple effects at home. Ford inherited a presidency tarred by the Watergate scandal and thus struggled for political legitimacy and public support. In contrast, Carter had to deal with severe economic slowdown brought on by energy difficulties. At home, both had to deal with serious problems like energy shortages, unemployment, and stagflation. These presidents did have some success abroad, but it was overshadowed by the numerous disasters they both endured. The power's leadership was frequently weakened by the setbacks. Even while the USA had some serious setbacks overseas, these had a big impact at home and made it seem like its influence was waning. 

Both Ford's and Carter’s presidencies were challenged significantly by a myriad of domestic challenges. Ford’s presidency was heavily tainted by a public perception of corruption, which led to a distrust of American institutions. In 1974, Ford decided to pardon Nixon, which increased distrust among the population and created rumors around his own corruption despite the fact he was not involved in the Watergate scandal whatsoever. This degraded Ford’s public image, making it hard for him to serve as an effective leader. Ford was also plagued by scandals with his secretary of agriculture, Earl Butz. Butz made derogatory comments using an Italian accent about the Catholic Church in 1974 and made a racist joke about African Americans in 1976. He was forced out in 1976, but this questioned the scrupulousness of Ford and his ability to make good decisions for the whole country and thus further damaged his reputation. Ford also struggled economically throughout his presidency. His presidency began with a recession, and inflation would continue to rise throughout. His ‘WIN’ campaign, designed to encourage people to save, also failed to make any progress domestically and became a laughingstock. There was also significant unemployment, 9% in 1975, which had not been seen since before the Second World War. Carter’s reputation was similarly tainted by scandals such as the firing of Bert Lance (budget director) due to dubious banking practices or Billygate, where his brother received $250,000 from the Libyan government for an unspecified reason. Carter’s political reputation and leadership were constantly brought into question during this presidency, which was a clear domestic failure. The economy also heavily struggled under Carter, with inflation reaching double digits in 1980 at 11%. Despite efforts to resolve the energy crisis, such as with the creation of the Department of Energy, Carter failed, and the price of oil continued to rise; a barrel in 1973 cost $3, and by 1979 it reached $30. In the same period, a gallon of gasoline went from 40 cents to more than $1. This was disastrous for consumers and further decreased his reputation; despite his best efforts, he failed to resolve this major political crisis. Further, Carter’s July 1979 speech, dubbed the ‘malaise’ speech, further upset the American people due to its tone-deaf nature when regarding the state of the American economy and political sphere. Carter failed completely domestically, and so did Ford. Both presidents were fundamentally disastrous for America domestically. 

Under both presidents, there were some major foreign successes. This is especially notable when compared to both presidents' immense domestic failures. Ford’s signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 was an important step in promoting human rights and fostering further communication between the east and west. They were controversial for legitimizing Soviet control over Europe but were undoubtedly a success due to the large steps of progress they made overall. The three ‘baskets’ of the accords were important agreements that ensured stability in Europe and a reduction of tension in the Cold War, which would ultimately benefit all peoples around the world. They gave further power to smaller states with their emphasis on cooperation in the areas of security, the economy, and, as mentioned, human rights. While they made concessions to the USSR, they would ultimately be an important step in weakening the polarity of the world and weakening the USSR. Ford’s continuation of the ‘detente’ policy was important as it eased tensions, greatly further defusing the Cold War, which should be seen as a success. Ford’s foreign policy was greatly successful in some areas but would be overshadowed by the significant failures he also experienced. Carter additionally had some successes. In 1978 he secured the signing of the Camp David Accords, ending the conflict between Egypt and Israel. This was significant as it would reduce tension among OP countries and potentially help bring an end to the energy crisis. It also reaffirmed America’s global position. It would lead to a peace treaty in 1979, stabilizing the volatile Middle East and ending hostility between the nations for the time being. Additionally, the Panama Canal Treaty, signed in 1977, must be regarded as a success. It helped to improve American relations with South America, and the symbolic commitment to the sovereignty of smaller nations was a positive step, according to many in the US and abroad. However, despite the President’s international success, it must be noted that they also faced significant challenges abroad that would feed into their domestic struggles. 

Foreign policy blunders plagued both Ford's and Carter's administrations, defining and tarnishing them. The fall of Saigon in April 1975, which resulted in a triumph for the North Vietnamese and ended the Vietnam War, was one of the most important events of Ford's administration. The chaotic evacuation of US personnel and allies from Saigon would come to symbolize America and Ford’s continuous failure in Vietnam. It was not only a literal military defeat but would become a great symbolic moment for the decline of the USA and was thus an absolute disaster. The fall of Saigon would diminish prestige and morale and further contribute to a declining national pride and a growing disillusionment with American leadership. This war would damage the American economy long-term due to its immense costs, which contributed to the various economic issues that Ford would face feeding into Carter’s presidency. Carter’s presidency was similarly filled with international disasters. Notably, the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which began in November 1979, began when Iranian militants stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 hostages. The crisis lasted 444 days, dominating Carter’s final year in office and symbolizing American weakness and the indecisive, failing leadership of Carter. Carter's credibility was further undermined and opinions of his incompetence were strengthened by his inability to handle the crisis, particularly the April 1980 operation Eagle Claw. It further undermined American trust in their government and was humiliating at home. Any achievements he made were overshadowed by the ongoing crisis, which played a major role in his election failure in 1980. It was a disaster for America’s reputation and Carter’s personally, as well as being a major disaster militarily; overall, it was a great disaster for the American foreign policy agenda. Another major failure and disaster under Carter was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, it marked the end of detente as the prevailing policy and a return to heightened tensions. This consequently undermined much of the success found in early negotiations, such as the 1975 Helsinki Accords under Ford. Carter’s reaction to sanctions, the Olympic boycott, and military aid to mujahideen fighters was strenuous on the American economy and would escalate hostilities further. Carter’s inability to decisively affect the situation would be damaging long term and would scar the end of his presidency. The economic strain of these policies further exacerbated the domestic issues Carter was facing of stagflation. These failures had profound effects on the domestic political sphere in the United States. They deepened public distrust in the government, exacerbated economic struggles, and deepened national decline. The feedback loop created by these failures ultimately made the presidencies of each seem and become hugely disastrous. 

Ford and Carter’s presidencies were ultimately disastrous for America both at home and abroad. However, there were more failures abroad than at home but these significantly fed into the issues at home. Especially, the economic strain of foreign policy fed into the already dire state of the American economy under the presidents. There was negligible success domestically under Ford and Carter and significant failures under both which were ultimately furthered by their foreign policy failures. There was undoubtedly some success abroad but this was vastly overshadowed by their failures. Their foreign policy failures were damning and fed into their other issues and overshadowed successes and would ultimately prove their presidencies disastrous.
