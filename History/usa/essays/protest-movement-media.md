To what extent did media attention contribute to the success of protest movements in the years 1965 to 1971? [25] 

During the years 1965 to 1971, there were significant protest movements focused on achieving further social progress for marginalised groups and promoting an end to the Vietnam War. Throughout the period, protests were affected by the media for both better and worse, but largely the media was a negative force on furthering the goals of the protest movement. The role of the government and the president in their response was highly influential, as can be seen by the importance of a supportive president such as LBJ. Another factor affecting the success of the protest movements was the organisation and leadership of the protests with differing strategies maintaining differing effectiveness. However, it is questionable to assume there was much success for the movement during this period; there was little progress for civil rights outside of a couple of acts, the Vietnam War raged on, and there was very little concrete progress for women. Overall, media coverage significantly harmed the reputation and success of the protest movement. Instead, a combination of government action, protest leadership, and strategic planning led to the movement's limited success in the 1960s and early 1970s. 

The media was largely damaging for the protest movement during this period. Media, inherently by its visual and often short-lived nature, focuses on highly marketable or dramatic events and occurrences rather than entirely factually accurate reporting. This would lead to a simplification and distortion of events that would damage the nuance of the complexities of the protest movements in the eyes of the public. This is exemplified by the media’s focus on events such as the Long Hot Summers riots, such as the 1967 Newark, New Jersey, riots. Rather than focusing on events such as the 1965-66 Chicago campaign or the Poor People’s campaign in 1968, the media chose to focus on the more sensational events of riots and conflict with the police. This turned the public and voters, especially, away from the justice and morality of the civil rights movement and led people into believing that the civil rights movement was inherently linked with violence. This would change the ‘silent majority’s’ perception of protest in a highly damaging way, fostering a belief that the movement had gone ‘too far.’. This pattern was followed by the media in 1968 when reporting at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, where coverage of the violence and brutality that happened overshadowed and overruled the message trying to be brought across by the students. The messages of the SDS and the Yippies were completely outshone by the calamity that happened with the out-of-control Chicago police force. Similarly, the women’s liberation movement and the second wave of feminism were overshadowed by an intense media focus on radical parts of the movement that ended up damaging the overall image of the push for further rights for women. The bra-burning protests outside the Miss World contest in 1968 gained huge media attention but instead just further pushed the ‘silent majority’ against further rights for women. While there was a large amount of coverage resulting from many of these events, it was often coverage that was indeed damaging for protest movements rather than contributing to their success. In fact, in most of these areas, the negative coverage led to a pushback and thus a step back away from the progress desired. The media during this period was largely damaging towards the protest movement. 

The way the government reacted to protests played an important role in their success. Repressive actions such as the extreme police reactions seen at many protests would further support the burgeoning protest movements of this period. The Kent State shootings in 1970 only caused further opposition to the Vietnam War and would thus positively impact the protest movement. In contrast, if the government at the time was liberal and pro-social progress, it could be hugely positive for protest movements. During LBJ’s time in office, there were several laws passed that would further the goals of protest movements. These included the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act, both of which would work to help and increase the political rights and economic opportunities of African Americans, respectively. In this way, the government was hugely important in achieving the ultimate goals of protest movements of the time. Johnson’s Great Society sought to improve life for all, which thus included the lives of many of the people the protest movements sought to benefit. This is contrasted by Nixon’s victory being based on restoring law and order and focusing on winning the ‘silent majority.’. This term was coined by Nixon in the lead-up to his 1968 election and would reflect the voter base he would win strongly with. This would then coincide with the relative slowdown of social progress for protest movements. Overall, it is clear that the actions, reactions, and attitudes of the current government were vital for the protest movements to experience success within this period. 

The organisation and especially the leadership of protests during this period were also important in influencing the success of the movement. The leadership of figures such as Martin Luther King during the earlier half of this period was essential. MLK gave the movement a central guiding figure and a moral centre that focused on nonviolent methods that the public largely agreed with. Martin Luther King held close ties and friendship with LBJ, and the Civil Rights movement would start to denigrate as a whole after his death. His death led to the Fair Housing Act shortly after in 1968, further proving his essentialness as a public face for the civil rights movement. Leaders in second-wave feminism, such as Betty Friedan, were essential for writing documents such as the NOW agenda and her own book, The Feminine Mystique, which were essential bedrock documents for the movement. Leadership was essential for both movements. The more sporadic and disparate anti-war movements, largely led by students and young people, were less well organised and thus largely less effective. Differences in approach between groups also affected the movement. The militant Black Panthers had much less success than SNCC or the SDLC led by MLK. The ways the movement and larger groups conducted themselves were important to either providing or stopping success. Overall, this was an important factor in success. 

It is contentious whether or not there was much success at all during this period. While the civil rights movement saw some success with the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the later 1968 Fair Housing Act, it would experience little success outside of this. This is especially notable as before this period there were huge strides where the movement proved to be highly effective, such as during the earlier periods in Johnson’s presidency or in the 50s. For the women’s rights movement, there was some success, but many of these occurrences cannot be attributed to the protest movement. The advent of birth control medications, among other advancements, cannot be attested to the protest movement. There was also a large backlash to both of these movements. The public's view of the increasing radicalisation of the civil rights movement led to a further disdain for the movement and all of its demands. The deaths of MLK and Malcolm X and the advent of more radical groups and movements, as well as the Long Hot Summers, set the civil rights movement back in many ways. For the women’s liberation movement, there was also the contrasting push against abortion coming from many women. These were regressive steps that acted as an antithesis to the radical strains of the protest movements. The antiwar movement also wholly failed as the war continued. Overall, protest movements during this period were largely unsuccessful. 

In conclusion, the media was frequently damaging to the little success seen by protest movements in this period. It was instead the government and the protests themselves that frequently led to progress during this period. The government's willingness or not to cooperate and push for social change was highly important in achieving the goals of protest movements. Similarly, the way protests were organised and how they were seen by the public was incredibly important in guiding whether they succeeded or not. Overall, protests during this period were largely unsuccessful. Despite this, it was not the media that led to the limited success; it was the government and the movement itself.
