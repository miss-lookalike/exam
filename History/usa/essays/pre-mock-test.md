The nature of this source is valuable as it is a law contemporary to the time and will reflect governmental policy. However, it is potentially limiting as it shows the perspective of business and the government but does not accurately represent labour organisations. The origin of the source as a law passed through Congress may be valuable, but it is limiting to a historian looking to study Truman's economic policy as Truman himself vetoed it. The bill would pass through as his veto was overridden, but this makes the source potentially limiting as it is an inaccurate portrayal of Truman's ideology. The purpose of the source as a law is valuable as it can show the economic problems Truman faced. There were several influential strikes leading up to this bill; in 1946, many employers rejected demands for pay rises, leading to 4985 strikes involving 4.6 million workers; this led to a loss of over 116 million working days. Strikes were frequently an issue for Truman, such as railroad strikes in 1946 leading to the signing of executive order 9727, which seized the railroads for governmental control. The source in this way is limiting as it reflects a significant economic challenge to Truman. Additionally, the source can be seen as valuable, as strikes would continue to be an influential part of Truman's economic challenges, such as in April 1952 with the steelworker's strike. Truman used executive order 10340 to seize control of steel companies and forcibly end strikes; this was called heavy handed and would damage the image of Truman as president. Thus, it could be seen as valuable to consider strikes an important challenge as this source does. Additionally, the tone of this source is quite neutral, as it is an officially drafted law. The content of the source can be seen as both valuable and limiting, as it reflects the economic challenges of the time. For example, when it is written that the act seeks to minimise anything that could "jeopardise the public health, safety, or interest," this is valuable as many strikes, such as substantial coal strikes or shipping strikes, would cause all major industries to come to a standstill, which would threaten the public. 68 million metric tonnes of coal production were lost during coal strikes, which would cause a massive detriment to the public. However, this could also be seen as limiting; business leaders and governments were incentivised to stop strikes and re-engage industry, so it is within their interests to convince the public that they want to protect them. Additionally, many of the more conservative Democrats and Republicans at this time wanted to create a freer market and unions got in the way of this so this act would help make the market freer and thus might not be for "public… interest". Additionally, when it is said, "It is the purpose and policy of this Act…to provide orderly and peaceful procedures," it could be seen as limiting due to the act harming unions. In 1945, 34.2% of people would be members of a union, and this would allow them to collectively and peacefully strike to try and achieve further goals with their labour, such as higher wages or better conditions. This act by slowly eroding union presence and power in America would erode this peaceful method of protest, so this can be seen as limiting for the source. Additionally, when it is written, "harms the general welfare," it could be seen as limiting. Striking was often beneficial to the general public as it raised wages and standards of work but was against the government's interest. Thus, it could be seen as limiting. Overall, this source is limiting as it gives a narrow view of Truman's economic challenges, such as inflation (between 1945 and 1946, inflation was 25%), and it also contradicts Truman as he himself vetoed it.

Martin Luther King was the driving force behind the limited success for civil rights that was seen under Kennedy. While other groups were influential such as SNCC or the NAACP it was ultimately King and his various actions throughout Kennedy's presidency that were the most influential factors in influencing Kennedy to make progress around civil rights. Another factor was the external influences of other powers during the cold war or governmental branches. There was overall little progress for the Civil rights movement under Kennedy but the little progress made was driven by King. Overall, Martin Luther King and his SCLC were the most influential factor. 

Throughout this period, King was highly active for the cause of civil rights. In 1957, King had started the Southern Christian Leaders Conference, which became an influential civil rights group, especially in organising non-violent protests such as the Birmingham campaign. The Birmingham campaign was particularly influential, as the violence witnessed in response to the peaceful protest would change Kennedy's mind on the importance of civil rights. Bull Connor, as the Commissioner of Public Safety, had said that "blood would run in the streets" before Birmingham would become desegregated. The campaign from April 10th to the 3rd of May would focus on sit-ins and non-violent protests, such as the beginning of a voter registration drive. The campaign was met with brutal violence against students, with many ending up in jail, forcing the city to negotiate with the SCLC, who had organised it. Robert F. Kennedy sent Burke Marhsall to negotiate and would gain desegregation; JFK would station 30,000 troops outside Birmingham. Despite promises from JFK to help African Americans during his 1960 campaign, he had not pushed legislation in Congress during 1961 or 1962. In June 1963, he would call for new CR legislation labelling it a 'moral issue'. JFK was sickened by images of Connor's actions, and this would lead to promotion of the Civil Rights bill. Additionally, King would deliver his famous "I have a dream" speech during his large march or rally on Washington on the 26th of August 1963. 250,000 people would attend, and news networks such as NBC would interrupt their usual coverage to broadcast King's speech. This is undeniably influential, as by 1960 90% of homes had televisions, so in addition to the hundreds of thousands in Washington, many would see his words at home. This march was popular with moderates and whites as it was entirely nonviolent, which made it more palatable than movements such as the Black Panthers. Of the 250,000 people attending, approximately 1/5 were white. Additionally, the SCLC under King's leadership helped the Albany Campaign from 1961 to 1962; however, his involvement here was complicated as the SNCC felt that MLK had come simply to experience the glory and was a top-down leader, which contradicted Ella Baker's views. As well as these high-profile examples of Martin Luther King's influence, he would give 350 speeches in 365 days in 1963 and was a constantly active figure in the larger civil rights movement. Additionally, during Kennedy's 1960 campaign, he would call to free MLK from jail, showing an early liking towards him and his movement. Due to his frequent influence throughout the period at both high-profile events and consistent smaller ones, King was the driving force behind the movements limited success under Kennedy. Additionally, King was seen as a more palatable alternative to the radical nature of the Black Panthers or other groups and was thus more liked by whites who still held majority power, such as in the Congress, where there was only one African American Congressman. Overall, it is clear that Martin Luther King was integral to the limited success of the movement in this era. 

While other groups drove progress to some extent, none were as influential as Martin Luther King and his SCLC. Other groups included the SNCC, the NAACP, and the Black Panthers. In February to July 1960, the Congress for Racial Equality would organise the Greensboro sit-ins at lunch counters in stores such as Woolworths. Students would sit in and counters and ask for service, and when rejected, service would refuse to leave. This would be repeated in hopes of causing desegregation and garnering mass media attention. It would gain attention due to the nonviolent major meant to attract media. However, it would be further publicised by King, which emphasises his centrality to the movement. Additionally, the Freedom Riders campaign would work to desegregate interstate transport. This was organised by the founder of CORE, James Farmer, who would go on the first ride in 1961. These would challenge the non-enforcement of 1946's Morgan v. Virginia and Boynton v. Virginia in 1960. The violent treatment of freedom riders and the continuous pressure on southern penal systems would force action. RFK would pressure the interstate commerce commission to make another ruling, which came into effect on the 1st of November 1961. This is an example of a group external to those led by King making a substantial impact for the civil rights movement. Despite the progress made by civil rights groups and leaders outside of King and the SCLC under Kennedy, there were also frequent moments of friction where progress was halted by the approach of groups other than King's. Kennedy was reluctant to respond to activism and would label the SNCC unnecessarily provocative and "sons of bitches." He would also say that Freedom Riders were unpatriotic due to embarrassing the nation at the height of the Cold War. Kennedy would frequently decline the requests of other organisations, such as the NAACP. Roy Wilkins, leader of the NAACCP, would say, "Everyone went out of there absolutely charmed by the manner in which they had been turned down," illustrating that many groups would have little favour with the president and thus progress was heavily impeded. Additionally, the methods of many groups were unpopular publicly too, a 1961 poll revealed that 63 per cent of Americans opposed the Freedom Rides.. Compared to King and his SCLC, many groups would have little sway with Kennedy, and this largely stopped progress being driven by these groups. Overall, it is clear that King was a much more important factor in driving progress under Kennedy in regards to civil rights. 

Other factors, such as external powers and the efforts of government branches, were also partially influential. For example, international pressure was often influential, such as around the freedom riders. The USSR would criticise the USA for its violent treatment of the freedom riders and lack of response, and thus racism. This is reinforced by Kennedy's comments that the riders were unpatriotic due to being an embarrassment to the world stage in an important time in the civil war. Despite America's claims to be a paragon of progress and liberal democracy, its treatment of minorities within its own borders was frequently an area of criticism for other powers around the world, notably China and the USSR. In Kennedy's special message to Congress on February 28, 1963, he would say, "It hampers our world leadership" while referring to the inequalities faced by African Americans. With the context of the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, the Berlin Wall in August 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, there was an incentive for America to focus on cleaning up their reputation internationally, and the lack of progress for civil rights was part of damaging their image around the world. While this can be considered a partially influential factor, it also cannot be overstated, as the pressure at home was also large and perhaps more troubling for Kennedy as the advent of media meant public opinion, and thus electoral favour was much more easily swayed at home. Another factor was the work of other government branches in comparison to the efforts of King. Public opinion during this period was not in favour of civil rights in general, partially due to certain groups taking extreme measures that disagreed with public ideas of protest and partially due to the prevalence of other issues. One poll in the Kennedy years showed that civil rights were at the bottom of the list of voter concerns. Even outside the South, there was opposition to civil rights, and this was reflected in Congress. Republicans combined with Southern Democrats to block or weaken civil rights legislation consistently. For example, they blocked Kennedy's civil rights bill in 1963. Many politicians would face electoral failure if they supported civil rights. For example, George Wallace failed to secure governorship in Alabama in 1958 due to being a moderate on race; when he became a racist candidate in 1962, he won by the biggest margin ever. He gained national recognition for saying, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation  forever." Various examples like this showed the incentive politicians had to ignore civil rights leaders, so it can be concluded Congress was not the driving factor either. 

It is questionable whether there was much civil rights success under Kennedy. While there were some influential moments, such as the end of the freedom rides and the desegregation of transport, there were also many areas where civil rights showed little progress. It is arguable that much of the progress made, such as the further appointment of forty African Americans to official posts, such as Andrew Hatcher as White House Press secretary, were examples of tokenism rather than genuine efforts to change. While Kennedy appointed 5 federal judges who were black, including Thurgood Marshall, he also appointed segregationists in 20% of his deep south judicial appointments. Many of the sweeping changes that Kennedy would gradually warm to would fall outside of his presidency as they were included in the July 2nd 1964 Civil Rights Act signed and passed through after his death on the 22nd of November 1963. King himself in the spring of 1963 had believed that the president had only adopted token measures and there was little concrete change, which would instead come under Johnson. His cautious approach to the civil rights issue resulted in minimal tangible progress. Kennedy would wait for opinion to change, which in this period it had not significantly. Overall, there was little change and progress, but the progress that there was had been directed by Martin Luther King. 

In conclusion, while there were several combining forces that drove success in the civil rights movement, it is undoubtable that Martin Luther King was the most significant. Martin Luther King was a popular figurehead for the entire nation and would lead several of the most significant events during this period, such as the Birmingham Campaign. His nonviolent methods were highly effective in convincing the moderate public. Other groups were less influential due to infighting and their own poor public perception. While external forces were important, such as other nations and Congress, they were less important than King again, as they often acted as obstacles to progress as much as helping it. Overall, Martin Luther King was the driving force behind success in the Civil Rights Movement in the Kennedy years.
