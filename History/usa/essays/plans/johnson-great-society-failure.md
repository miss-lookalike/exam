# Intro

[[introduction-advice-2q]]

- Context:
	- [[Johnson-legislative-jfk]] - context
- Points:
	- War on poverty
	- CR
		- This and war on poverty are closely linked
	- Health, Social and education
- State judgement
	- Long term foundations for success? (Nixon doesn't touch them and later presidents won't either)
	- On the surface it looks like it failed (Media + Middle America said this) however as historians we know this is due to Vietnam
	- Promises vs reality - the Great Society is inherently unrealistic

# Conclusion

Overall, the Great Society program did not fail despite how many wished to represent it as having failed. The Great Society left long-term foundations that became untouchable and greatly influenced the lives of millions of Americans. Johnson's war on poverty had been greatly successful in lifting many Americans over the poverty line. While it was not complete, it made a clear difference. Johnson also made huge strides for civil rights with the early Civil Rights Act (1964) and the later Fair Housing Act (1968), which would target the systemic discrimination African Americans faced. Additionally, the poverty that African Americans disproportionately faced was addressed by Johnson. Medicare and Medicaid helped large swathes of people access health care, and this would greatly improve the lives of many. These foundations laid by Johnson through his Great Society program remained untouched by Nixon and by presidents even until today. This must be regarded as a success because not only did the program help millions of Americans, but it would go on to help millions more, truly proving its impact.
