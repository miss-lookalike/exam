	- Johnson's legislative achievements were not largely due to Kennedy's legacy. America had moved on past Kennedy towards the end of 1964, and through the following four years, Johnson would effectively use his own political acumen and take advantage of the growing powers of the presidency to achieve much more than if he was just using JFK's legacy.
