 A: 

The nature of the source could be interpreted as limiting due to it being a speech to a group of new college students; this group could be naive, leading to Kennedy’s rhetoric. This could also mean he does not want to reveal the inner workings of his policy, as this is a public speech delivered for the world to see. The fact that this is a speech could also be limiting, as it would be given in emphasised rhetoric rather than precise political terms. However, the fact it comes from Kennedy directly adds value for a historian as it means it is Kennedy’s opinion, which at most has been slightly weakened. This is reinforced by Kennedy’s later signing of the partial nuclear test ban treaty in 1963. Kennedy’s handling of the Cuban missile crisis to go for a peaceful negotiation and quarantine instead of bombing or raids helped keep peace in one of the tensest moments of his presidency. From this angle, the source seems highly valuable as it reflects genuine foreign policy under Kennedy. The repetition of the words “peace” and “war” makes the tone seem dramatic and consequential, which effectively reinforces Kennedy’s point but could be seen as limiting due to overexaggerating his message. The repeated emphasis on “nuclear” weapons or exchanges emphasises a piece of foreign policy Kennedy would follow with the signing of the partial test ban treaty signed with the USSR. However, JFK’s emphasis on “peace” seems limiting when faced with his actions in the Bay of Pigs in April 1961. Kennedy would use a plan formulated by Eisenhower to start an insurgence using Cuban exiles and US air support; this plan would increase tensions and push Cuba much further towards the USSR. This could very well have started a total war, contradicting what was said by Kennedy in this speech. While during the Cuban missile crisis Kennedy would negotiate for peace, much of the crisis began due to the placement of missiles in Turkey by the USA. This was recognised as an aggressive action by the USSR and was an important part of the negotiations between the two superpowers. This may limit the source, as Kennedy was willing to make aggressive moves such as this. However, Kennedy’s willingness to take the missiles away does show a priority for peace. Kennedy prioritised peace as well in Berlin in October 1961, when the wall began construction, choosing to have a standoff rather than start an all-out war in Europe. In Vietnam, Kennedy would refuse to withdraw even after Diem’s assassination due to it being potentially damaging to his re-election chances. This shows him prioritising his political career over peace, which makes the source limiting. Overall, this source is quite valuable, as there are certainly moments where Kennedy would act aggressively and start issues overall in conflicts such as Berlin, Cuba, and Vietnam. He would successfully navigate a path to peace, showing that it is his priority as indicated in the source. 

B: 

Kennedy’s foreign policy was mostly a failure, as at best he retained his position or maintained peace, such as in Cuba, and at worst he completely lost part of Berlin without reacting in any way. Kennedy’s foreign policy was mostly successful in the Cuban missile crisis but a complete failure in the Bay of Pigs invasion. Kennedy’s policy in Berlin was also a disastrous failure. In both cases, the promises much outweigh the reality of his policy. While in Vietnam, he avoided escalating to total war and avoided committing troops; he would escalate it significantly and refuse to withdraw too. Overall, Kennedy’s foreign policy was a failure. 

In Cuba, Kennedy’s foreign policy was varied and ultimately would be mostly successful. January 1961 would see the first trade deal between the USSR and Cuba, which, combined with the further context of the nationalisation of US oil refineries and other businesses, would cause concern for the US. When combined with the fact that Cuba was within striking distance of the vast majority of American cities, being only 90 miles from Florida, having a communist neighbour seemed daunting for Kennedy. Kennedy’s first response to the issue of Cuba was the execution of a plan created by his predecessor, Eisenhower, and the CIA. This would be conducted on April 17, 1961, and would be an abject failure. 1400 Cuban exiles, along with American air support, would invade Cuba from the Bay of Pigs, which would lead to the capture of 1200. This, in the short term, was an embarrassment for the newly elected Kennedy and the United States as a whole. In the longer term, it would lead to Kennedy being dominated by Khruschev at the Vienna summit of June 1961 and a development of relations between the USSR and Cuba that would lead to the placement of missiles. Despite the apparent total failure, Kennedy’s approval would go up after this incident, perhaps indicating that this form of direct action, even if failing, was popular and indicating that the incident may not have been a “disastrous failure." The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 would be a much more effective event and would prove Kennedy’s foreign policy could work for peace. On the 18th of October, nuclear missiles were discovered by a U2 spy plane, and a naval quarantine would be implemented on the 22nd. This would prevent more missiles from reaching Cuba. On the 26th of October, Khrushchev offered to remove missiles in exchange for ending the blockade and not invading Cuba. On the 27th, he added that the US was removing missiles from Turkey. Kennedy accepted the first offer and ignored the second, but he threatened to invade on the 29th if the USSR did not confirm. Khrushchev accepted and was seen to have backed down; however, a secret part of the deal led to the US removing missiles from Turkey and Italy. This was an example of expectations not meeting reality as Kennedy never disclosed the removal of US missiles. This shows Kennedy’s skills as a negotiator and can be interpreted as a success. If the objective is peace, this was surely a success and would lead to major developments such as the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the installation of a hotline between the Kremlin and the White House. This was seen as a triumph for Kennedy by most and was an example of a successful piece of foreign policy. While the Bay of Pigs was an objective failure, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world closer to peace and thus showed Kennedy’s foreign policy was successful.  

In Berlin, Kennedy’s foreign policy was largely unsuccessful and cautious. The establishment and continued presence of the Berlin Wall were disastrous failures for Berlin residents. Kennedy met Khrushchev in June 1961 at the Vienna summit after the Bay of Pigs incident, which led to Khruschev feeling he could bully the younger and naiver Kennedy. The Berlin issue was yet unresolved. In August 1961, a barbed wire barrier, followed by a wall (which stood until 1989), was put up between East and West Berlin to stop East Germans from crossing. Those trying were shot or faced imprisonment. In October 1961, there was a face-off at Checkpoint Charlie. Kennedy was testing if US military personnel could cross as guaranteed by 1945's Potsdam Treaty. The USA and Soviet tanks crept up, but the Soviet tanks were the first to back off. Kennedy did not react significantly, seeing a wall as better than a war. Khrushchev's view that Kennedy was weak was reinforced. He saw Berlin as a weak spot that could be exploited to control the West. Not only did this weaken Kennedy’s position in the minds of other leaders such as Khruschev, but it also saw a failure by Kennedy to protect the citizens of Berlin, which was a total failure as Kennedy was totally dominated by Khrushchev. The wall remained, and Kennedy did nothing about it, which was a disastrous failure. In 1963, Kennedy travelled to West Berlin and stated his commitment to the city and freedom in general in his "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech. This was not followed up on by Kennedy, and this shows a difference between the promises and reality of his foreign policy. Overall, Berlin under Kennedy was a disastrous failure and became known as a weak spot for Khrushchev. Kennedy failed the people of Berlin, but he did manage to keep peace.  

In Vietnam, Kennedy’s foreign policy can be seen as a failure due to his unwillingness to withdraw and his increasing escalation. However, Kennedy’s policy in Laos can be seen as successful. Much more media attention was given to Laos during 1960 than to Vietnam. There was also a huge investment in Laos to avoid it becoming the “first domino” of domino theory. In 1962, a new Geneva accord was signed establishing Laos as a neutral country governed by a tripartite coalition of pro-communist, pro-American, and a neutral faction. While this is somewhat of a compromise, it was still overall a success as it secured Laos as a neutral country that could not be invaded. In Vietnam, Kennedy would bring dramatic escalation, going from 1000 military advisors to nearly 17,000. This was after the Rostow-Taylor report of 1961, which said escalation was needed to support the South and ensure its security. Kennedy took the middle road rather than sending thousands of ground troops or withdrawing; this could be seen as a failure as it led to more investment and time into Vietnam than a quick, decisive end to the war. The US used a 'flexible response' including'strategic hamlets’ guarded by the army, which were villages taken over by the US after the civilians had been moved to other places. The Vietcong, however, was better at winning over peasant support. Diem, the South Vietnamese leader, continued to mistreat the Buddhist majority due to his own Catholic beliefs. This would lead to his assassination on November 2, 1963. This was seen as the correct time by Kennedy’s own brother among world leaders for Kennedy to withdraw troops. However, the instability would pull the United States in further. Kennedy refused due to the looming re-election campaign and committed more resources to Vietnam. Withdrawing would be seen as a defeat, as at this point most people believed the USA would win. Military historian Greg Daddis wrote, “The one common failing of most military officers and senior civilian officials… was their faith that military power, broadly defined, could achieve political objectives in post-colonial states." While Laos was mostly successful, albeit a compromise, Vietnam was almost completely unsuccessful, with major resources being invested in a war that Kennedy refused to fully commit to. While Kennedy did stop a full-scale war, he did continue to escalate and refused to remove troops due to his own political ambitions. Vietnam was an immediate failure but also a long-term failure as Kennedy’s actions would lead to a disastrous war. 

In conclusion, Kennedy’s foreign policy was a disastrous failure both in the long and short term. His promised policies also did not often live up to reality, such as the undisclosed removal of US missiles in Turkey and Italy and the failure to actually react in any way in Berlin. While he did preserve the peace in Cuba and Vietnam in both of these places, he made major concessions, and Vietnam would lock the US into a further war following his refusal to pull out after the assassination of Diem, despite the insistence of his brother and various world leaders. Overall, Kennedy’s foreign policy was a disastrous failure on most issues presented to him.
