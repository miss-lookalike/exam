'Eisenhower's foreign policy in Europe differed significantly from his foreign policy elsewhere in the world.' Assess the validity of this view. [25] 

Eisenhower's policy coming into office was to 'rollback' communism over the entirety of the world, using 'new look' strategies, but the reality was often different. 'Rollback' was a policy of actively trying to roll back Communism instead of just contain it. When Eisenhower came to office, he appointed John Foster Dulles as his foreign secretary and Allen Dulles as the head of the CIA, who were both rollback supporters and became vital to his foreign policy. 'New Look' was the idea to use covert operations such as CIA initiatives as they were cheaper than conventional warfare. Eisenhower enacted rollback more heavily outside of Europe, such as in Asia and Latin America. Outside of Europe, economic factors also became more relevant. Eisenhower also consistently pushed for peace worldwide. The setting of Europe made it difficult to change regimes or take other drastic measures due to the proximity of the USSR. It differed significantly, but not due to a conscious bias in policy but rather due to the geopolitical reality of the continent. 

Eisenhower's policy in Europe was frequently characterised by a more cautious and less direct approach. Most notably, Eisenhower enacted no regime changes in Europe. When presented with the opportunity to support a people's revolution against the USSR in Hungary in 1956, he decided not to engage due to fears of an all-out war with the USSR. Eisenhower also used financial aid in Europe more than any other continent. Hungary was one of the largest failures in foreign policy during Eisenhower's presidency, but the inaction was due to the geographical closeness of the USSR. Hungary was an example of a situation where Eisenhower did not enact rollback or even containment, and this differed significantly from his policy on other continents. In 1951, when Eisenhower signed the Mutual Security Plan, which was the continuation of the Marshall Plan, more money was given to Europe than any other continent. In other continents, Eisenhower preferred covert intervention, whereas in Europe, diplomacy was often used. On November 10th, 1958, Khrushchev demanded that western powers, including the United States, leave Berlin in under six months. Instead of performing an act of aggression, Eisenhower turned to diplomacy and met with Khrushchev in Geneva. This contrasts with Vietnam, where Eisenhower sent military advisors instead of using diplomacy. A point of continuity in Eisenhower's foreign policy was a push for peace. The cold war 'thawed' under Eisenhower; he gave the 'Chance for Peace' speech and the 'Atoms for Peace' speech, which asked for the sharing of information on nuclear reactors. Malenkov's mutual understanding with Eisenhower allowed peace in Korea, in contrast to Stalin. This continued under Khruschev, who looked to negotiate rather than take a hardline approach as Stalin had; he announced his aims for 'peaceful coexistence' in a 1956 speech, and this sentiment had been echoed by Eisenhower. In Europe as well as other places, Eisenhower sought to maintain outright peace and rely on covert operations; this was a continuity in his foreign policy. Eisenhower did use some covert operations in Europe, such as the continuous use of the U2 spy plane up until the shooting down of Gary Powers. This was an immense success and was a technological advantage the Americans held; it was highly advantageous and heavily used in Europe along with other continents which is another consistency. Eisenhower also did not use troops in Europe, which matches the overall aims of his policies to 'balance the books' and is consistent with most other examples. Overall, Eisenhower's foreign policy differed heavily in Europe, but mostly due to the position of the USSR, which made acting almost impossible. 

Eisenhower's foreign policy in the Middle East was more overt and was more successful than his foreign policy in Europe. The only time Eisenhower used troops was in Lebanon in 1958. This was a significant difference between European foreign policy and policy in the Middle East. Eisenhower was frequently unwilling to deploy troops even outside of Europe, such as in Iran. The CIA did not believe Communism was a threat in Lebanon, so this is more of a move out of strategic interests. Iraq had fallen just before, and this could be seen as the start of instability in the region. This sent a clear message of Eisenhower's intent and would coincide with Eisenhower's 1957 'Eisenhower Doctrine' letting people know that his policy in the Middle East was intervention. It ended in a regime change, which was a frequent part of Eisenhower's foreign policy outside of Europe. Eisenhower used the CIA to cause a regime change in Iran in 1953. This was an example of his 'new look' policy, as Eisenhower used the CIA's full power to overthrow Mossadegh. This was another place where economic interests came into play, whereas Europe was often more strategic; 73% of western consumer oil came from Iran, and Mossadegh wished to nationalise oil, which would threaten this crucial resource. Eisenhower giving $1 million to Kermit Roosevelt instead of investing like the mutual security program or using diplomacy like Berlin is a notable difference in foreign policy. The Suez crisis also shows a difference in foreign policy. Eisenhower supported the strengthening of Britain and France in Europe, but when they tried to hold onto their colonial possessions in the Middle East, the policy was different. Egypt also shows consistency, as up until the Suez Crisis of 1956, the USA had been sending funding to Egypt as it would in Europe for countries under the mutual security program. Preserving peace did not seem to be Eisenhower's top priority, and this is not consistent with Eisenhower's foreign policy. Additionally, economic interests were at the forefront rather than strategic, which also does not correlate with his European policy. Eisenhower also created the Central Treaty Organization in the Middle East to promote unity in the region consistent with his policy of strengthening NATO. Overall, Eisenhower's policy in the Middle East differs significantly from his policy in Europe. This is partially due to the distance of the USSR compared to Europe. 

Eisenhower's policy in Latin America and Asia was more aggressive in nature than in Europe, but they share some similarities too. Regime changes were used frequently, which was a difference from Europe. The 1954 Guatemalan coup was an example of the CIA using covert tactics (influencing the media) to force a regime to change for American economic interests rather than strategic ones. This coup was vastly different from the revolt in Hungary, as popular backing did not come from the people. Cuba was an example of covert action again with the formulation of the Bay of Pigs plan. While this plan would fail under Kennedy, it illustrates again that Eisenhower was willing to take riskier actions in his foreign policy when outside of Europe. Guatemala was a large success, which also contrasts with Eisenhower's actions in Europe, which largely failed. Korea was an example of Eisenhower prioritising peace, and Vietnam was an example of Eisenhower being unwilling to be dragged into an all-out war. This avoidance of war in Asia does correlate with Eisenhower using money like he did in Vietnam or diplomacy like he did in Korea. By the end of the decade, the USA had funded 75% of all South Vietnamese imports and provided 85% of the funding for the South Vietnamese military, which is comparable to the large amount of money spent on the Mutual Security Program. This starkly contrasts with Eisenhower's actions in Quemoy and Matsu, which were described as 'dangerous brinkmanship' by contemporary political commentator Adlai Stevenson. The threat of nuclear warfare contradicts his speeches, such as 'A Chance for Peace'; it also contradicts the policies of keeping peace that were enacted in Europe. Eisenhower was willing to meet with Khruschev in 1959 over issues in Berlin but was not willing to meet about Vietnam or Cuba, highlighting that Europe may hold more importance to him. Eisenhower also created the Southeast Asian Treaty Organisation with the Manila Treaty in 1954, which is consistent with his European policy of strengthening NATO to avoid isolationism. Overall, there are very large differences in foreign policy in Asia, Latin America and Europe. 

In conclusion, while Eisenhower had some similarities in policy, there were vast differences. There were similarities in areas such as pushing for peace, avoiding all-out war, and creating intergovernmental organisations. However, there were many differences, such as the willingness to take risks, the use of regime changes, and the CIA. It is clear to see that there were vast differences in both policy and levels of success. This is partially due to the positioning of the USSR in Europe and other factors, such as the ability of the CIA to covertly overtake nations.
