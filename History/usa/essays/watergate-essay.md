‘Richard Nixon has received too much blame for Watergate.’ Assess the validity of this view. [25] 

Watergate was a scandal starting in 1972 that would ultimately lead to the resignation of Nixon in 1972. It focuses centrally on the burglary and taping of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972 (the Watergate hotel) and Nixon’s subsequent cover-up. There were several groups involved in the scandal and its growing and worsening scope; these include Nixon himself and his inner circle as well as external factors such as the media. It is clear that Nixon ultimately is primarily to blame due to his direct involvement in the scandal. It was ultimately Nixon who created the air of paranoia and would lead the cover-up and thus is ultimately to blame. He largely betrayed the trust of the American people by abusing executive power at the height of the imperial presidency. Thus, overall, Nixon received appropriate blame for Watergate. 

Nixon received appropriate blame for the Watergate scandal as he was the sitting president, an intensely moral position for the American public. He was also the centre of the crisis and the following cover up. This was demonstrated in the “Smoking Gun” tape recorded on June 23, 1972, just days after the break-in. In this tape, Nixon instructed his Chief of Staff, HR Haldeman, to have the CIA pressure the FBI into stopping its investigation by claiming it was in the interest of national security. This is a clear abuse of presidential power and was done in the interest of protecting himself and his administration. The release of this tape in 1974 proves that Nixon was not only aware of the scandal but originated and orchestrated the coverup. This clearly proves guilt and demonstrates part of the reason he deserved the amount of blame he received. Beyond just this conversation Nixon worked to continue the coverup. He approved hush money payments to pay off the burglars using campaign funds furhter worked to obstruct justice. His consistent use of executive privelige and power to block investigations shows further his willingness to act above the law as a way to protect himself. This is further exemplified by the “Saturday Night Massacre” in October 1973. Nixon would attempt to make Department of Justice officials fire the prosecutor Archibald Cox who was trying to release the White House Tapes. Both Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus would resign in protest before Robert Bork would fire Cox. This event would lead to the beginning or Nixon’s impeachment proceedings only 10 days after. There was national outrage. This event only further demonstrates Nixon’s willingness to break the law and use his power to obstruct justice to try and coverup his wrongdoings. It was Nixon’s paranoia and secrecy that would lead to the “Plumbers” unit who were designed to prevent leaks. While much of the illegal activity was carried out by his staff it was done under his leadership and thus must ultimately be blamed on Nixon. Without his effort and instructions to create a coverup Watergate would not have evolved to one of the most damaging events in American political history. Nixon was ultimately the architect of his own downfall and is the central and most culpable figure in the Watergate scandal. 

While Nixon is ultimately responsible for Watergate and thus received an appropriate amount of blame, it must be concluded that his inner circle was also significant. Key figures such as HR Haldeman (Chief of Staff), John Ehrlichman (Domestic Affairs Advisor) and John Mitchell (Attorney General and head of Nixon’s campaign) were deeply involved in the break-in and the subsequent cover-up. Haldeman and Ehrlichman were instrumental in coordinating efforts to suppress damaging information and blocking the investigation to protect Nixon. John Mitchell, as the head of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP), approved the funding for the break-in, which was subsequently carried out by the “Plumbers unit”. The wiretapping and burglary were funded by CREEP and approved by Mitchell. Figures like G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt were directly responsible for organising the break-in but ultimately acted on behalf of Nixon’s administration and team. Nixon’s allies played an undeniable role in executing illegal activities and sheltering the president. Many of Nixon’s allies would lie under oath. White House Counsel John Dean would organise payments to the burglars and further the cover-up. However, Dean would later testify against Nixon, showing that for many of those involved in the scandal, they were uncomfortable and were following orders. Nixon’s subordinates, while deeply involved, acted to protect Nixon while following his orders in a cover-up created and orchestrated by Nixon. Many would not have acted illegally if it was not for the involvement of Nixon and the highest-up figures in his administration. Nixon’s approval of the cover-up as shown in the White House Tapes proves that he was not a bystander and was directing the large number of people who would carry out and direct the cover-up. Although his subordinates would act illegally, their actions were directed and in the interests of Nixon.   

External forces were important in amplifying and exposing the scandal to the public, but this does not diminish the level of blame deserved by Nixon. Investigative journalists, especially Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, were instrumental in uncovering and publicising key details of the scandal. They exposed the connection between the break-in and Nixon’s re-election campaign (CREEP) utilising the help of FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. The media’s persistent coverage kept the scandal in the public eye and increased the pressure put on Congress to act to try and further investigate Nixon. Some would argue that the media put too much blame on Nixon and overexaggerated his role in the scandal. However, the facts and evidence discovered in the White House Tapes prove that Nixon was aware of the scandal from the beginning and proved he was undoubtedly guilty. Journalists were essential in pushing against the force of the cover-up from Nixon and his associates. Additionally, the Democrats were central in the congressional investigations of Nixon. Democrat figures played a leading role in the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, using televised proceedings to expose Nixon and his administration’s corruption to the public. While some would argue that the Democrats only pursued and prosecuted Nixon in the interest of winning back partisan credibility after their landslide defeat in 1972, this would ignore the overwhelming evidence against Nixon and the principle of correcting the imperial overreach of the American presidency. While the Democrats certainly influenced the speed of Nixon’s downfall, it was Nixon himself who created his downfall by expanding and creating the scandal. Without Nixon’s obstruction of justice, abuse of power and attempts to silence witnesses, there would have been nothing to prosecute. While external forces did centralise the Watergate scandal, this is understandable, as it is one of the most monumental events in American political history. It was ultimately Nixon who created the scandal and other parties who just responded to it. 

Overall, it is clear that Nixon is the one to blame for the Watergate scandal and thus received an appropriate amount of blame. While it is true that Nixon’s subordinates did act illegally and commit many of the wrongdoings during the scandal, they did this under the permission and advice of Nixon. Nixon additionally created the paranoia- and suspicion-laden environment that led to the scandal. While reporters and Democrats did focus on Watergate, this is only natural, and Nixon created the scandal they were responding to. In conclusion, Nixon received appropriate blame for the scandal, as it was ultimately his doing and would cost his party and the political institutions of America for years to come. One of the things that largely doomed Ford’s administration was his pardon of Nixon and the corruption this indicated; political faith plummeted.  Nixon received appropriate blame, as he would doom American political institutions in the eyes of the public for decades to come.
