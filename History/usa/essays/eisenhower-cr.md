The success of the civil rights movement heavily depended on the NAACP. The civil rights movement, as the popular movement towards the liberation and desegregation of African Americans, was led heavily during this period by the NAACP. However, other groups such as SCLC and individuals such as Rosa Parks or Ella Baker were also influential. The government was often, frankly, unhelpful or willingly obstructing social progress and change. It will be shown overall that the NAACP and its lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, were the most influential, and the civil rights movement did depend on them, and they achieved undoubtedly the most material good for African Americans in this period. 

The successes of the civil rights movement during this period were heavily reliant on the NAACP. The most important Supreme Court decision of the time, 1954 Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, was argued by Thurgood Marshall in the Supreme Court, who would find unanimously that the Plessy v. Ferguson of “separate but equal” was unconstitutional. This would slowly erode segregation in white schools, leading to an improvement in the quality of education for African Americans, which would contribute to a higher quality of life over time. He also won Brown v. Board of Education II, which said all schools must desegregate with ‘all deliberate haste’. The work of Thurgood Marshall under the NAACP is unparalleled, with 29/32 of the cases he argued winning. This includes Browder v. Gayle (1956), which ended segregation in Alabama transport. While the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 may have begun African Americans of Alabama’s campaign against segregation on transport, it was Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP that successfully won the case. Additionally, Rosa Parks, who started the boycott by refusing to stand up, was a chapter secretary for the NAACP at the time and shared the NAACP’s goals of enfranchisement for African Americans. Thurgood Marshall also won Cooper v. Aaron 1958, which was a reaction to the Little Rock crisis of 1957 and denied the Arkansas school board from delaying integration further and would set a legal precedent for the same. He finally won Boynton vs. Virginia in 1960, which outlawed all segregation by race on public transport. While Thurgood Marshall does not represent the entire NAACP, he was a key member and was supported by them in his legal battles with the Supreme Court. Members of the NAACP would also end up organising many of the countries sit-ins, with Ella Baker, the later founder of the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, being a previous NAACP member herself. The later civil rights acts of 1957 and 1960 would focus on the suffrage of African Americans, which was one of the primary aims of the NAACP and its members, believing it was the only way to free African Americans. The NAACP’s various legal battles massively benefitted African Americans ending segregation on transport and improving education leading to an overall improvement of life. While Southern states would frequently keep their institutions, such as schools, segregated, the beginning of the end of segregation was won by the NAACP in the rejection of separate but equal in Brown v. Board of Education. The Chicago Defender declared it “a second emancipation." Despite the efforts of Southern Democrats and other members of government, the NAACP did achieve a lot, and the legal precedents they set will be influential for the future as well. Overall, it is clear to see that the NAACP and especially its members, such as Thurgood Marshall, were the most influential in this period. 

 Other groups and individuals were influential to success but not as influential as the NAACP. SNCC, or the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, was formed by Ella Baker in April 1960, who was a previous member of both the Southern Christian Leaders Conference and NAACP. This organisation would help to organise the sit-ins during 1960, which would contribute to the Commission on National Goals in November of the same year. The Commission, despite its makeup of all white men who were relatively old, would be quoted as finding that “discrimination on the basis of race must be recognised as morally wrong, economically wasteful, and in many respects dangerous,” and they would suggest denying federal funding to businesses that were segregating, such as Woolworths, which would end up desegregating due to the report and the sit-ins. This group, while influential, was only founded in 1960 and had few influences compared to the scale of the NAACP. Another group, SCLC, was founded by Martin Luther King and was influential since they reached religious and middle-class people, especially in the South, as the name implies. This was influential due to other groups not necessarily targeting these groups. Martin Luther King was influential and a member of the sit-ins; he would later be imprisoned for his sit-in, and Eisenhower would not react by painting him negatively. Despite the influence of other individuals such as the aforementioned MLK or Ella Baker, the media found a counterweight in the militant Malcom X, and this decreased some of the popular influence of these individuals. Overall, none of these individuals or groups had the same material success and influence on African American lives as the NAACP did during this period. 

The government was varied in its impact on success, but overall, outside of the judiciary, it was hardly helpful. The executive branch of Eisenhower was known at the time as being sympathetic to the South, as he grew up in Texas and was previously a member of the segregated military. He was also quoted as saying “that a Negro could not court my daughter,” and he only met civil rights leaders once. Justice Douglas described him as being in “ominous silence” due to his lack of early response to Little Rock or moral leadership on civil rights. In comparison to the NAACP, Eisenhower did very little to help the cause of civil rights. When Eisenhower launched the Civil Rights Bills of 1957 and 1960, they were heavily weakened in Congress by southern Democrats, which Eisenhower did little to stop. While they provided some gain, they gave little material benefit or enfranchisement as intended; however, MLK was quoted as saying, “Any bill is better than no bill,” which was a sentiment some held at the time positively for Eisenhower or the legislature. The first bill only franchised 3% of African Americans, but the second one did manage to make obstructing desegregation a federal crime. The judiciary was the most influential branch of the government in terms of success. They would unanimously support Brown v. Education and support Brown v. Education II, Crowder v. Gayle, Cooper v. Aaron, and Boynton v. Virginia. Earl Warren would preside over a massively liberal court, and they by far would help progress the civil rights movement more than any other branch of government. However, all of these cases were brought forward by the NAACP and won by Thurgood Marshall, so it is clear to see that without the NAACP, little progress would have been achieved at all. State governments were often obtrusive, such as Orval Faubus, who blocked Little Rock 9 from going to school. Southern Democrats such as Harry Byrd, James Eastland, and Richard Russell would support the Southern Manifesto, which would oppose desegregation and civil rights for African Americans. Overall, the government branches except for the judiciary were often either obtrusive or were fighting against progress entirely, and the cases the Supreme Court supported were brought forward by the NAACP. 

In conclusion, the civil rights movement did depend on the NAACP and especially the legal battles of Thurgood Marshall. They won by far the most protections or rights for African Americans, such as equal schooling and desegregation of transportation, and stopped state governments from delaying integration. While other groups were influential to the movement, such as the SCLC and the SNCC, these groups came much later and achieved much less, and many of their successes, such as the sit-ins, were also influenced by the NAACP, with Ella Baker, the founder of the SNCC, being a previous NAACP member. Rosa Parks was also an NAACP member. The government in most branches was unhelpful, and some, including southern Democrats, fought against progress. However, the judiciary branch did a lot of good, but most of the cases they supported came directly from the NAACP, and without the NAACP, these would not have been won. Overall, the NAACP was the most influential factor in the success of the civil rights movement by far, and it did depend on them.
