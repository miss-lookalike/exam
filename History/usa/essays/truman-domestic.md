Inflation was a significant problem faced by Truman and was the most significant issue he faced during his presidency during the immediate post war period and his early presidency, whereas political divisions would follow his entire presidency. Truman faced a multitude of other issues including Political division and social division among the complicated class and racial bounds in an America changed by the New Deal. Inflation caused many of the problems that made Truman look like a weak and unable president. Many of the economic issues faced by Truman were due to inflation and the economy’s poor state. Truman faced large economic issues under his early presidency with strikes and high inflation being a common part of his first term, but political divisions followed him through his entire presidency. This can be seen by the recovery of the economy under Truman contrasted with the continued divide of his party. 

 Truman inherited a very divided country, and this caused him many issues during his presidency. Under Truman the House Un-American Activities Committee was created to try Americans for Communist affiliations this caused an atmosphere of fear and paranoia. This was no doubt encouraged by the Truman doctrine with Truman being told to ‘Scare the hell out of the American people’ by Senator Vandenberg. In the same year of 1947 Truman signed in the Loyalty-Security program giving the FBI powers to investigate any federal employee, this led to the investigation of over 3 million employees. His motives were political, the previous autumn Republicans used the idea that the democrats were soft on communism effectively as a way to discredit Truman as a president, in this time they used the slogan ‘Communism vs Republicanism’. Truman was still seen as soft on communism with 73% of a survey from spring 1948 considering Truman soft on Soviets. This led to Truman enabling Hoover’s FBI to commit unlawful acts to help quell the spread of Communism in the United States, these include the FBI’s more than a dozen burglaries of the National Lawyers Guild office to illegally gather evidence for HUAC. This would ultimately lead to more division and the passing of acts that Truman himself would try to veto. Some of these laws were the McCarran act which passed over Truman’s veto and would require all Communists organisations such as the CPUSA to register with the federal government. Political divisions were a large issue for Truman’s presidency, and this can be demonstrated by the 1948 election being seen as already won by Dewey against Truman’s bid for his second term. Truman faced a breakdown in his own party previous in this election when southern democrats split off from the party due to his decision to integrate the United States armed forces. This branch of the Democrat government became known as the ‘Dixiecrats’ and were led by South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond. This was also seen as a blow to Truman’s domestic hold on the country as the south had been traditionally a democrat stronghold. Truman had also faced grief from Republicans over the loss of China that was perceived as Truman’s failure of foreign policy, this was again used as a smear of Truman’s presidency as a whole. Political division can also be seen with the failure of Truman’s new ‘fair deal’ which can be attributed to his loss of congress and senate and his party not wanting more programs that may increase inflation or negatively impact their reputation ahead of the 1948 election or 1950 congress election. Truman also faced large problems between 1947-1949 when he lost the Congress and Senate, many bills he tried to pass including many portions of his new ‘Fair Deal’ would struggle to be passed due to this division. It is also notable to mention that another part of the Democrats split off too being the Liberals guided by Henry A. Wallace. Overall, it is clear to see that Truman struggled greatly domestically due to Political divisions he faced within his own party and in the country as a whole and failed to address these issues throughout his entire two terms. 

Truman also faced large social divisions during his presidency that presented significant challenges to his security in office and his party. Truman integrated the United States army in 1947 after a 1946 survey found white sergeants to be largely in favour. In 1953 just after the end of Truman’s second term 90% of African American soldiers had been integrated in the army. While this was a successful policy and would win the African American vote for the forthcoming 1948 election it would also split the party with Strom Thurmond’s Dixiecrats leaving the democrats. Truman also gave speeches at the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People 27th June 1947 address, in this speech he again promised the evening out of the American dream. He followed this up with the To Secure These Rights report from his civil rights commission. All of the suggestions from the report were ignored by congress including the plan to setup a permanent civil rights commission. This can be attributed to the social division of America with many Americans including the current congress – which only had 0.46% black representatives for 10% of the population – not taking the issue of civil rights for African Americans seriously. It is notable that Truman had tried to resolve the issue of civil rights but failed due to many factors, including the aforementioned Congress not regarding it as an important issue as well as the general national consensus not regarding it as a major issue. Truman also faced issues due to the division of class in American society, he often found it hard to please both business and labour. For example, during strikes businesses wanted higher prices and lower wages and unions wanted pay rises to help cope with inflation. Truman often struggled to appease both sides and this would lead to several problems for his presidency including many of the points the republicans put against him at the 1948 election and 1947 congress election. While this issue was significant for Truman it did not pose as large of a threat as either inflation and the economy or political divisions. 

  Inflation and the troubled economy were some of the most significant problems faced by Truman in his presidency. Truman faced an inflation rate of 25% between 1945 and 1946 and this would lead to several other problems including strikes. Post war Truman implemented the GI bill which Accounted for 15% of the federal budget, prevented a flood of the labour market by providing benefits for veterans such as university. This in the long run led to large prosperity but during the short term of his presidency Truman would issues such as the previously mentioned large inflation. FDR’s New deal programmes and WW2 led to a high budget deficit for Truman and with the removal of WW2 price controls the economy strted to inflate quickly and caused problems for businesses and working people in America. Conservative democrats and republicans wanted the restoration of free markets with little government intervention so declined the price controls. In 1946 many employers reject demands for pay rises from employees and unions and this led to 4985 strikes involving 4.6 million workers and the loss of over 116 million working days. For example, the nation's train companies were losing $25 million a day and 68 million tonnes of coal production was lost. In the runup to the 1948 election the Republicans used the slogan ‘Had Enough?’ referring to the sky-high inflation and frequent strikes of Truman’s early presidency. This would combine with bills such as the 1947 Taft-Hartley bill aimed at unions that Truman tried to veto but failed. While Truman’s early presidency was faced with many economic issues it can be seen that this was turned around by Truman: by the end of Truman’s presidency 1952, the total economic output has increased by 90% on 1939 levels; Industrial output doubled, agricultural output by a third and Business; investment had risen from an annual rate of $14bn to almost $38bn; and the per capita income of Americans had risen about 40% of pre-war levels. Truman still faced large domestic problems due to the economy such as his attempted seizure of steel mills in 1952. With support from legal advisers and the Chief Justice, Truman used his executive powers to seize control of the steel mills telling his staff that ‘The president has power to keep the country from going to hell,’. The union appealed to courts and the supreme court voted that Truman had exceeded his executive authority and this led to a 6-3 decision for the stell millers' union. The supreme courts (Truman appointed some of the justices) voted that Truman had exceeded his executive authority - 6-3 decision for the Union. It is clear to see Truman had great domestic trouble due to inflation and the economy in his early presidency but in most of his later presidency he had great success in stabilising and improving the economy leading to British prime minister Edward Heath saying that this period was ‘The greatest prosperity the world has ever known’. 

In conclusion, while the economy and especially inflation were significant factors in Truman’s early presidency by his late second term, he had resolved many of these issues. Truman led the US to a high level of prosperity, which would continue after his presidency ended, and thus it cannot be concluded that this was the most significant issue. Whereas political divisions, such as the split in the Democrat Party or the division between the executive and the legislative over civil rights, followed him throughout his presidency. Additionally, the collapse of Truman’s fair deal due to his own parties and the Republican Party's lack of support for more policies following FDR’s new deal was an exemplification of the domestic issues he faced. The large improvement of the economy contrasted the political divisions that Truman faced throughout his presidency and was unable to quell.
