# Congress and Public Opinion

Most Southern whites remained vehemently opposed to black equality. Many leading citizens belonged to [[citizens-councils]] and some even joined the Ku Klux Klan.

Southern white businessmen were divided: in 1963, many in Birmingham ([[birmigham-campaign]]) felt that segregation damaged business, but were aware that if they took the lead in integration they risked a white customer backlash. For example, after Martin Luther King Jr's campaign in St Augustine, Florida, in spring 1964, some white businessmen reluctantly desegregated, but when their premises were picketed and firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan, they resegregated.

In addition, Southern whites who supported civil rights were likely to be ostracised by the rest of the white community. For example, Mississippi newspaper owner Hazel Brannon Smith recorded how 'my newspapers were boycotted, bombed and burned… my life was threatened and my husband lost his job', as a result of her pro-civil rights editorials.

White juries were unwilling to convict fellow whites who murdered African-Americans. For example, NAACP official Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi in 1963. Byron De La Beckwith, who belonged to both the Citizens' Council and the Ku Klux Klan, was arrested. However, two juries failed to find him guilty (he eventually found guilty and imprisoned – in 1994).

There was also popular opposition to civil rights outside the South. Racism and respect for states' rights help explain the opinion polls that showed that most American voters believed integration should evolve gradually rather than through federal enforcement. One poll in the Kennedy years showed that civil rights were at the bottom of the list of voter concerns.

Many whites outside the South considered the black protests dangerously provocative. For example, a 1961 poll revealed that 63 per cent of Americans opposed the Freedom Rides.

Naturally, Congress responded to the wishes of the electorate and Republicans combined with Southern Democrats to block or weaken civil rights legislation. Congress diluted Eisenhower's civil rights bills in 1957 and 1960, and blocked Kennedy's civil rights bill in 1963.

# Southern Politicians and Law Enforcement Officials

Discrimination against African-Americans by Northern law enforcement officials played an important part in provoking the black ghetto riots of 1964-8. However, Southern law enforcement officials were far worse. Many, such as Bull Connor, were both willing and determined to maintain segregation, although not all of those who went along with segregation were racists. After the disastrous campaign in Albany, Martin Luther King Jr said, 'I sincerely believe that Chief Pritchett is a nice man, a basically decent man, but he's so caught up in a system that he ends up saying one thing to us behind closed doors and then we open the newspaper and he's said something else to the press.

Most Southern politicians were Democrats. While Northern Democrats were relatively liberal on race, Southern Democrat politicians constituted the most conservative group within the party. As so many African-Americans remained predominantly unable to vote, Southern politicians from both major parties responded to a predominantly white electorate that sought to retain the Jim Crow laws on segregation. Indeed, a politician who failed to support segregation might not get elected. Governor George Wallace in Alabama is a good example.

## George Wallace

Prior to 1958, the Democrat George Wallace was a moderate on race. In his 1958 gubernatorial campaign he was supported by the NAACP and he criticised the Ku Klux Klan, which endorsed his opponent, John Patterson. White Alabamans had voted for moderates such as Wallace before, but the Montgomery bus boycott frightened many white voters and made them more extreme. Patterson defeated Wallace easily, prompting Wallace to tell an aide, 'I was out-nword by John Patterson. And I'll tell you here and now, I will never be out-nword again."

In 1962, Wallace ran for Governor again, this time as a racist. He declared his opposition to black voter registration, blamed integration for increasing crime and unemployment, and worked closely with the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, he won the election by the biggest margin ever. In his inaugural address in January 1963, he declared his support for states' rights ('I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny'). His call for 'segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever' gained him nationwide recognition.

Alabama was the last state to integrate its universities. When Kennedy federalised the National Guard to ensure the integration of the University of Alabama in 1963, Wallace advertised his racist credentials to white voters by standing defiantly on the university's steps. Wallace ran for president in 1968, and won 13.5 per cent of the popular vote (the Republican candidate Richard Nixon won 43.4 per cent, the Democrat Hubert Humphrey won 42.7 per cent). All of Wallace's votes came from Deep South states.

# Opposition to Activists' Methods

Some Americans sympathised with the aims of the civil rights movement but disliked the methods and counselled patience. Among them were the Kennedys. In 1961, Bobby Kennedy condemned white attacks on SNCC workers attempting to register black voters in Mississippi, but said:

Mississippi is going to work itself out. Maybe it's going to take a decade and maybe a lot of people are going to be killed in the meantime But in the long run I think it's for the health of the country and the stability of the system.

President Kennedy considered SNCC unnecessarily provocative 'sons of bitches'. 'SNCC has got an investment in violence,' he said.
