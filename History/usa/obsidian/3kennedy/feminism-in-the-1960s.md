# What Problems Did (white) Women Face?

- More women were increasingly in work since WW2 but most were in low paid work such as waitressing or cleaning. More educated women were pushed into 'traditionally feminine' roles like teaching or nursing which plays into stereotypes about women being nurturing.
- Many employers were sexist. Congresswoman Martha Griffiths scolded an airline for firing air stewardesses when they reached 32 or got married - "You are asking… that a stewardess be young, attractive and single. What are you running, an airline or a whorehouse?"
- Early 1960s: women were: 80% of teachers, 10% of principals, 7% of doctors, 3% of lawyers
- Eighteen states refused female jurors, six said women needed a male co-signer for financial agreements. Schools expelled pregnant students and fired pregnant teachers. Some states prohibited contraception for married women
