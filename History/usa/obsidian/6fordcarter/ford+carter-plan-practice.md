Home and abroad - foreign + domestic

1974-1980

Home - Staglflation, Weak leadership, political corruption
Abroad - 
    - Bad: Vietnam, Iran, Afghanistan
    - Good: Panama, Helsinki, Camp David

Argument: More disasters abroad but they had massive ripple effects at home

1. Home negative
2. Abroad positive
3. Abroad negative (link - effects at home)

Paragraph 1: Domestic Challenges and Failures
1. **Economic struggles**:
   - Stagflation (high inflation and unemployment) under both presidents.
   - Ford’s "Whip Inflation Now" (WIN) campaign seen as ineffective.
   - Carter’s struggles with energy crises and rising oil prices.
2. **Political and social issues**:
   - Ford’s pardon of Nixon (1974) damaged public trust.
   - Carter’s perceived lack of leadership and inability to work with Congress.
   - Growing public disillusionment with government (e.g., "malaise" speech, 1979).
3. **Limited domestic achievements**:
   - Ford’s focus on restoring trust in government post-Watergate.
   - Carter’s successes in environmental policy (e.g., Department of Energy) and deregulation.

Paragraph 2: Foreign Policy Challenges and Failures
1. **Ford’s foreign policy**:
   - Continuation of détente with the USSR, but criticized for being too soft.
   - Fall of Saigon (1975) seen as a failure of US foreign policy.
2. **Carter’s foreign policy**:
   - Iranian Revolution (1979) and hostage crisis, damaging US prestige.
   - Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979) and perceived weakness in response.
   - Panama Canal Treaty (1977) criticized for conceding too much.
3. **Perceived decline in US global influence**:
   - Rise of Soviet expansionism (e.g., Angola, Ethiopia).
   - Loss of confidence in US leadership among allies.


Paragraph 3: Successes and Mitigating Factors
1. **Ford’s achievements**:
   - Stabilizing the post-Watergate political climate.
   - Helsinki Accords (1975), promoting human rights and détente.
2. **Carter’s achievements**:
   - Camp David Accords (1978), a major diplomatic success in the Middle East.
   - Emphasis on human rights as a cornerstone of foreign policy.
   - SALT II negotiations (though not ratified, demonstrated commitment to arms control).
3. **Long-term impacts**:
   - Both presidents laid groundwork for future policies (e.g., Reagan’s economic reforms, emphasis on human rights in foreign policy).
