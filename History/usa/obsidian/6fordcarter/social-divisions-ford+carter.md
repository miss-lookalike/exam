[[gay-rights-ford-carter]]

American culture had long been homophobic, but the 1969 stonewall riots were influential. Five days of resistance to police harassment. Lesbians were increasingly vocal too. Attitudes were slowly changing

- [[NOW]] endorsed gay rights (1973)
- Californian voters rejected suggestions for homophobic legislation (1978)
- the 1980 Democratic Party platform supported equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation

However, these signs of progress contributed to a conservative backlash. Ford and Carter stayed silent

In 1978, Senator Edward Kennedy said the development of a 'permanent underclass in our society…[constituted] the great unmentioned problem of America today': The less sympathetic criticised the 'welfare mentality' - the way in which welfare became an accepted way of life for successive generations. While the Republican President Ford was a firm believer in self-help and had no real ideas or impact on poverty and welfare, the Democrat Carter was expected to care and to do more about poverty. However, Carter faced several problematic demographic trends:

- The fastest growing section of the American population was the elderly, which necessitated increased federal government expenditure on Social Security and health care. Carter was a fiscal conservative, keen to balance the federal budget. He wanted to rationalise and reform those government programmes without increasing federal expenditure.
- The continuing 'white flight' of middle-class taxpayers to the suburbs and from the Northern or 'Snow Belt' cities to the Sun Belt (see page 169) led to the further deterioration of poverty-stricken Northern city centres.
- The economic recession of 1973-5 further increased the numbers living below the poverty line, which rose from 11.2 per cent in 1974 to 12.5 per cent in 1976. Amongst them were 50 per cent of all black female heads of household. The numbers eligible for food stamps grew from 18.5 million in 1976 to 20 million during the 1980 recession.

Carter made little progress on these problems, despite the allocation of $4 billion for public works in 1977 and increased federal aid for food stamps for the poor. problem was that taxpaying voters did not want to subsidise the poor, of whatever age, colour or sex, and the fiscally conservative Carter wanted to balance the budget.

[[native-americans-hispanic-ford-carter]]

By 1960, half the 700,000 Native American population lived short, hard lives on reservations where unemployment ranged from 20 to 80 per cent and life expectancy was 44 years, twenty years below the national average. Those who migrated to cities such as Minneapolis lived in ghettos. Then Native Americans became amongst the greatest beneficiaries of President Johnson's War on Poverty. Although some resented the resulting welfare dependency culture. Increased Native American activism, inspired by the NAACP and the civil rights movement. was a contributory factor behind Nixon's 1975 Indian Self-Determination Act. The Native American situation improved between 1945 and 1975, but while some Native American nations would prosper as a result of the Supreme Court's 1976 Bryan v. Itasca County ruling, which facilitated the establishment of lucrative gambling casinos on reservations, most have never participated in the American Dream.

Like Native Americans, Mexican-Americans suffered social and economic inequality and were inspired by black activism. The most famous Mexican-American activist was César Chavez, who gained national fame through his leadership of striking agricultural workers in California in 1965. Just as Black Power inspired Red Power amongst Native Americans, so Hispanic Americans became more militant in the late 1960s. The Chicano movement put Mexican-American needs firmly on the national political agenda. Mexican-Americans and Puerto Rican activists in East coast cities gained greater political representation and cultural reorganisation Ford and Carter did little to combat social divisions between the majority white population and Native Americans and Hispanic Americans
