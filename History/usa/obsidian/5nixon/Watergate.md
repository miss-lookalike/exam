The pardon

- Ford pardons Nixon on the 8th of September 1974 
- He has to pardon Nixon - 'we cannot have Nixon's trial hanging over your presidency'
	- 'End the American tragedy swiftly'
- Nixon is in atrocious health -> suicidal?
- Nixon accepting the pardon = admittance of guilt 
- Nixon receives $60,000 salary

Watergate consequences

- Damages America's global reputation - the [[rule-of-law|rule of law]] is hugely important in American politics so maybe it looks good for America
- Feels like part of a bigger story of government distrust
- Definitely damaged American's faith in the presidency -> turn to Reagan so he can restore the regal magnificence of the presidency 
- A more partisan America

Watergate in culture, conspiracies - 'the establishment'

- All the president's men, The parralax view, the conversation
- Impact on American idealism
- Sinister forces, corrupt establishment

Nixon's legacy

- Nixon is comic - bowling
- Nixon as a 'moral turd floating in a sewer'
- Nixon was much more liberal than given any credit for, had fantastic foreign policy achievements. 
- Nixon as a tragic hero, in Nixon as a man you see yourself - you see all your anxieties in him

How did Watergate damage the following?

- The government / democracy
	- Takes away faith in the government - effectiveness of the [[rule-of-law]]
		- Loss of trust leading to the 'credibility gap'
	- Imperial presidency yanked back by other branches
	- 1974 -> 38% turnout - people disconnected from democratic processes
- The Republicans
	- Loss the 1976 election
	- Tarnished reputation 
	- Split in the party between Nixon supporters and those who want to move on and disassociate themselves
		- Further split between Reagan and Ford - looks like Reagan wants to challenge in 1976 election but Ford wins the nomination. Reagan's new right is rising
- The Presidency
	- Lost of trust and prestige
	- National + international 
	- End/death of the imperial presidency - reeling of the executive especially by the legislative 
	- Reagan - neo-liberal + charismatic

>[!Essay question]
>'Richard Nixon has received too much blame for Watergate.' Assess the validity of this view.

1. Inner circle/close aides - Liddy, Hunt, Ehrlichman, Holdismann
2. Nixon - Smoking gun conversation
3. Media/democrats - Ervin committee, Soaps, Washington post, Democrats control impeachment process
4. Imperial presidency - constitutional crisis, previous examples (Gulf of Tonkin LBJ, Truman steel mills, Cambodia + Laos Nixon, FBI + Cointelpro vs CR movement)

Link between 1 and 2, Nixon created the atmosphere - culture of paranoia + dirty tactics
