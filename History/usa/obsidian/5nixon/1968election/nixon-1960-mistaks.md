Mistakes last time:
- Bad relationship between Ike and Nixon - Nixon not allowing Ike to campaign for him
- Nixon looked like death on the TV debates
	- Nixon went to 50 states to campaign, looked sick, knee operation
	- JFK had W rizz, contrasting suits, good angles
- Eisenhower refused to open up federal reserve in 1959 - recession going into 1960

- Avoids debates all together
- Only interviews with friendly journalists 
- Julie Nixon + David Eisenhower wedding in 1968
