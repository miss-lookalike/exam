##### Summary

In 1968, Senator Eugene McCarthy challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson for the Democratic nomination, mobilizing anti-war and disaffected youth. McCarthy’s strong showing in the New Hampshire primary and Robert Kennedy's subsequent candidacy, along with widespread disapproval of Johnson's Vietnam policy, led to Johnson's withdrawal from the race.

The Democratic Party was divided into three factions: anti-war liberals, centrists loyal to Johnson, and conservatives who opposed the Great Society and favored strong action against communism and domestic unrest. Meanwhile, George Wallace founded the American Independent Party, appealing to "white backlash" voters, expanding his focus beyond segregation to include opposition to protesters and intellectuals.

Robert Kennedy won the California primary on June 5, 1968, but was assassinated that same night, following Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder two months earlier. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August saw violent protests outside and tense proceedings inside, where Hubert Humphrey secured the nomination with a pro-Johnson Vietnam platform. The violent images broadcast from the convention damaged the Democratic Party's image.

Humphrey struggled to distance himself from Johnson's unpopular presidency, while Republican Richard Nixon gained support with vague promises of a plan to end the Vietnam War. Third-party candidate George Wallace also attracted a significant portion of voters. In the November election, Nixon narrowly defeated Humphrey with 43.4% of the vote to Humphrey’s 42.7%, while Wallace took 13.5% and five Southern states.

The election marked a major shift for the Democrats, who had previously dominated with their New Deal coalition. The South, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, largely supported Nixon or Wallace. This marked the beginning of a long-term realignment, as Southern support for Democrats dwindled, and many white working-class voters turned to Nixon or Wallace due to concerns over social programs and civil rights, fracturing the New Deal coalition.

By the late 1960s, the New Deal political order was unraveling. Gallup polls showed a sharp decline in the number of Americans identifying as "liberal," dropping from 49% in 1963 to 33% in 1969. In his January 1969 Inaugural Address, President Richard Nixon acknowledged the extensive government programs enacted since Franklin Roosevelt's presidency but suggested that government had reached its limits in solving societal problems.

Nixon's remarks reflected a broader shift in public sentiment, as many Americans lost faith in the liberalism of the New Deal and Great Society. The political and social foundations that had sustained this era were now weakened, signalling the end of a dominant liberal agenda.

##### Outline the campaigns of McCarthy, Kennedy, Humphrey, Wallace and Nixon

##### Explain how the New Deal coalition finally came to an end in 1968

The New Deal coalition, which had united a broad base of voters under the Democratic Party since the 1930s, finally unravelled in 1968 due to several key factors:

1. **Vietnam War and Civil Unrest**: The Vietnam War deeply divided the Democratic Party. Anti-war Democrats, like Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy, challenged the Johnson administration, while Hubert Humphrey, tied to Johnson’s policies, struggled to unify the party. The war, combined with widespread civil unrest, alienated many traditional Democratic voters, especially working-class whites who felt disconnected from the anti-war and civil rights movements.

2. **Fractured Democratic Convention**: The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago was marked by violent clashes between anti-war protesters and police, which were broadcast nationwide. The chaos inside the convention hall, where party loyalists pushed through Humphrey’s nomination and endorsed Johnson’s Vietnam policies, reflected the internal divisions within the party. This violence and division severely damaged the party’s image.

3. **George Wallace's Third-Party Candidacy**: George Wallace’s run as a third-party candidate for the American Independent Party siphoned off a significant portion of the Democratic base, particularly Southern whites and working-class voters. His strong law-and-order stance, opposition to civil rights reforms, and criticism of federal intervention appealed to voters disillusioned with the liberalism of the Great Society and New Deal eras.

4. **Shift of Southern Support**: Traditionally, the Democratic Party had relied heavily on the support of Southern states, but in 1968, the South largely supported either Wallace or Nixon. The civil rights movement and Johnson’s Great Society reforms, which expanded government involvement in welfare and social issues, alienated many Southern whites, breaking their long-standing loyalty to the Democrats.

5. **Rise of Conservative Sentiment**: Richard Nixon’s campaign capitalized on the growing conservative sentiment among voters who were tired of social unrest, the Vietnam War, and the perceived excesses of government programs. Nixon’s call for "law and order" and his promise to end the war in Vietnam appealed to voters dissatisfied with the direction of the Democratic Party. His narrow victory marked the beginning of a conservative shift in American politics.

Overall, the combination of the Vietnam War, racial tensions, and the rise of conservative backlash fractured the New Deal coalition. Southern whites, working-class voters, and others who had once been core parts of the Democratic base shifted their loyalties, leading to the coalition's final dissolution in the 1968 election.

- Had Whitehouse for two full terms but did not have a majority in the congress or the senate. 
- If Dixiecrats + Democrats united they would have fun
