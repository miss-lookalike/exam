Kissinger:-
- Harvard professor interested in foreign relations
- Tried to attach himself to Kennedy's but failed and offered himself to Nixon
- 'What interests me is what you can do with power' 'Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac'
- Nixon liked Foreign policy the most and worked on it closely with Kissinger
- They liked bypassing traditional diplomacy
- Nixon made William Rogers secretary of state who did not care about foreign policy, but Nixon told Kissinger this guaranteed White House control
- 'I'm sorry about how Henry and Bill get at each other. It's really deep seated. Henry thinks Bill isn't very deep, and Bill thinks Henry is power-crazy. And in a sense ,they are both right'
- Nixon Years later - 'Rogers felt that Kissinger was Machiavellian, deceitful, egotistical, arrogant and insulting. Kissinger felt that Rogers was vain, uninformed, unable to keep a secret and hopelessly dominated by the state department bureaucracy.'
- It was known in Washington Kissinger would treat his staff like mushrooms: kept in the dark, stepped on and frequently covered with manure
