# New frontier speech

> It is time, in short, for a new generation of leadership.
> 
> All over the world, particularly in the newer nations, young men are coming to power—men who are not bound by the traditions of the past—men who are not blinded by the old fears and hates and rivalries—young men who can cast off the old slogans and the old delusions.
> 
> For I stand here tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier. From the lands that stretch 3,000 miles behind us, the pioneers gave up their safety, their comfort, and sometimes their lives to build our new West.
> 
> Some would say that those struggles are all over—that all the horizons have been explored—that all the battles have been won—that there is no longer an American frontier.
> 
> But I trust that no one in this assemblage would agree with that sentiment. For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won. And we stand today on the edge of a new frontier—the frontier of the Nineteen Sixties; the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils; the frontier of unfulfilled hopes and unfilled threats
> 
> The New Frontier is here, whether we seek it or not. Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace end war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.
> 
> It would be easier to shrink from that New Frontier, to look to the safe mediocrity of the past, to be lulled by good intentions and high rhetoric—and those who prefer that course should not vote for me or the Democratic party.
> 
> But I believe that the times require imagination and courage and perseverance. I'm asking each of you to be pioneers toward that New Frontier. My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age—to the stout in spirit, regardless of party—to all who respond to the scriptural call: "Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be dismayed. "
> 
> Give me your help, and your hand, and your voice. Recall with me the words of Isaiah:
> "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary."
> 
> As we face the coming great challenge, we too, shall wait upon the Lord and ask that He renew our strength. Then shall we be equal to the test. Then we shall not be weary. Then we shall prevail.
> 
> Thank you.
