# Eisenhower's Errors

- Instead of promoting Nixon's candidacy, Eisenhower was furiously defending his presidential record against, Kennedy's attacks on his policies on defence and poverty. When Kennedy claimed 17 million Americans were to bed hungry each night, Eisenhower snapped, 'They must all be dieting'
- Nixon's candidacy was damaged by two Eisenhower policy decisions
	- After the 1959 budget deficit of nearly $13 billion, Eisenhower and Congress agreed huge spending cuts to ensure a surplus in 1950. Eisenhower ignored Nixon's warning that this would contribute to a recession and damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon was proved right
	- Eisenhower refused to refute Kennedy's inaccurate accusations of a 'missile gap' in the Soviet's favour, because it would expose U.S. covert actions and might prompt Khruschchev into a further arms build-up/ This left Nixon looking weaking on defence.

# Nixon's Errors

Nixon did bad on TV after ignoring Eisenhower's warning:

- While Kennedy looked straight at the cameras, Nixon looked sideways at Kennedy and projected shiftiness
- After a weekend at Cape Cod, Kennedy seemed relaxed and a picture of glowing health, while Nixon was tired and recovering from an infection.
- Sweat streaked Nixon's makeup, his eyes were hollow and black-ringed, and his jowls drooped.
- 'My God! They've embalmed him before he even died', exclaimed Chicago's democrat mayor Daley.

Nixon failed to capitalise on freeing MLK Jr which JFK would capitalise and do well because of. Henry Cabot Lodge Nixon's running mate promised a black cabinet losing southern votes.
