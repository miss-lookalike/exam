The Treatment ‘The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson’s offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself—wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach. Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scor, tears, complaint, the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mim- icry, humor, and genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless … The Treatment began immediately: a brilliant, capsule characterization of every Democratic Senator: his strengths and failings, where he fit [sic] into the political spectrum; how far he could be pushed, how far pulled; his hates; his loves. And who … must oversee all these prima donnas, put them to work, knot them together, know when to tickle this one’s vanity, inquire of that one’s health, remember this one’s five o’clock nip of Scotch, that one’s nagging wife? … Nobody but Lyndon Johnson.
