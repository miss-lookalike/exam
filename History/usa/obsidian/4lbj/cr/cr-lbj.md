# End of JFK

November 22nd 1963: JFK assassinated

![[Pasted image 20240305094511.png]]

Jackie Kennedy was still covered in JFK's blood at this point as this was immediately after the assassination

# Why Does LBJ Take the VP Role

- Power
- Waiting in the wings
	- Kennedy could have died due to his poor health or assassination

---

# Johnson and CR

LBJ is from Texas so before this would maybe have to be careful for not pushing CR too hard

'When they had to go to the bathroom, they would allâ€¦ pull of on a side road, and Zephyr Wright, the cook of the vice-president of the United States, would squat in the road to pee. That's wrong. And there ought to be something to change that' - Johnson (when VP)

'What the hell is the presidency for?' - LBJ (1964) - after being asked to delay Civil Rights bills by an advisor due to the election coming up

'I'll try to be worthy of your hopes' - LBJ to MLK - LBJ got rid of the JFK policy to wiretap MLK

[Fannie Lou Hamer's testimony](https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/sayitplain/flhamer.html) at the Democratic National Convention 1964

- LBJ did a press conference so it wasn't heard on tv
- It got replayed everyday on radios due to the story of LBJ trying to cover it up
- [[MLK]] and others could not do what she did

- Democratic National Convention
	- Formulating policy
	- Who is on the ticket for November?

# 'The Freedom Summer' 1964

- June - August
- 5.3% of AA in Mississippi registered to vote (1962)
- Mississippi Burning murders (Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner)
- Created 'Freedom schools'

- No member of the Klan is sentenced until much later

# Why it Passed

- Black activists drew the attention of Congress and the nation to injustices
- [[NAACP]], labour unions and churches lobbied Congress
- JFK had won over the Rep Minority Leader before his death
- Hubert Humphrey and other Congressional Dems had worked hard on the bill
- LBJ used JFK's memory
- January 1964 - 68% of people approve of CR Act

# Political Impact

> [!Quote]
> "We're turning the Republican party over to the South, for my lifetime and probably for yours" - LBJ to his aide

- Dems were previously for white supremacy
- This was disrupted by FDR, Truman, JFK and Johnson who were going for AA votes and improving rights
- Republican were previously the party of Lincoln
- 1960s onward would capitalise on 'Southern White disillusionment'

[[1965-selma]]

Johnson was more confident now as he had won a massive landslide in the 1964 election

# 'A Right to Vote' Tape of [[MLK]] and LBJ

- King - 'that you didn't carry in the south - the five southern states have less than 40% of the Negroes registered to vote'
- King - 'Coalition of the Negro vote and the moderate White vote that will really make the new south'
- LBJ - Equality for all and everyone should have votes
- LBJ - wants MLK and other leaders to repeat the worst examples over and over as it will get stuck in peoples minds and they realise its not fair
- LBJ - 'I think the greatest achievement of my administration, I think the greatest achievement in foreign policy - I said to a group yesterday - was the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act'
- LBJ - 'this will do even things the 1964 couldn't do'

- Relationship between Johnson and King
	- They both help each other - what they can do for each other
	- Mutual respect between the two
	- Frustration due to lack of progress
	- LBJ was the only president Roy Wilkins (president of the [[naacp]]) gave credit too
- Their strategy moving forward
	- If you repeat something enough time people will believe it
	- 'get it everyplace you can, pretty soon the fellow that didn't do anything but follow - drive a tractor, he'll say, "Well that's not right, that's not fair"'
	- New south of AA and moderate whites
- Why is voting so important
	- Your say on how your country is run
	- Only places LBJ didn't win had low AA vote
