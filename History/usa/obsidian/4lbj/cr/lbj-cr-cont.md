- [[edmund-pettis-bridge-march-or-bloody-sunday]]

On March 7, 1965, more than 500 marchers attempted to cross the Edmund Pettis Bridge, when state troopers confronted them and demanded that they turn around. The marchers halted facing the troopers, and the troopers advanced on the marchers, attacking them with nightsticks and tear gas. SNCC leader John Lewis was clubbed in the head and suffered a skull fracture. Images of the attacks on the peaceful marchers were broadcast throughout the country, and the incident became known as "Bloody Sunday." Two days later, Martin Luther King, Jr., led a group of protestors on another march from Selma. When police confronted them, however, they knelt in prayer and turned around.

- [[lbj-calls-voting-legislation]]

On March 15, 1965, [[LBJ]] addressed a joint session of Congress to introduce voting rights legislation. **In a moving oration, Johnson called on white Americans to make the cause of African Americans their cause too.** Together, he explained, echoing the anthem of the civil rights movement, "we shall overcome".

Johnson spoke of events in Selma as a historic moment and continually pressed the right to vote as a fundamental American right, proclaiming, *"Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote."* He stressed that denying the right to vote to African Americans cheapened the ideals of America for everyone.

The Voting Rights Act passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support. On August 6, 1965, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. The act outlawed practices, such as literacy tests, that had been used to keep African Americans from registering to vote. The Justice Department gained the power to intervene where discriminatory practices had kept less than 50 percent of eligible voters from registering to vote. If this intervention failed to fix the situation, federal registers could take over the local voting systems.

President Johnson, the master legislator, pushed for the passage of a strong bill to end the disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South. Together with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act effectively ended the systematic segregation of the South.

- [[selma-montgomery-march]]

Led by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., thousands of peaceful protesters marched over several days from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in reaction to the police murder of activist Jimmie Lee Jackson as well as to highlight civil rights efforts in the state. This was actually the third attempt to complete the March; the first ended in the notorious "Bloody Sunday" attack of protesters by Alabama state troopers, and the second, "Turnaround Tuesday," ended when MLK led the crowd back in compliance with a court order. The third March followed after a federal judge ruled the marches' First Amendment right to protest could not be infringed, allowing the marches to proceed without being hindered by law enforcement. Widely televised with particular media attention on "Bloody Sunday," the series of marches was successful in bringing national attention to civil rights issues in the state and led to Johnson's proposal of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

> [L]listening to leaders like [Nasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser "Gamal Abdel Nasser"), [Ben Bella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Ben_Bella "Ahmed Ben Bella"), and [Nkrumah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah "Kwame Nkrumah") awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a Black and White problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.

> Brother, remember the time that White collegegirls came into the restaurant‍—‌the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the Whites get together‍—‌and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent, I saw White students helping Black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then‍—‌like all [Black] Muslims‍—‌I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.
