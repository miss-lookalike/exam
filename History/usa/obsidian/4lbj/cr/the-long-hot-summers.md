Each summer between 1964 and 1968 saw race riots in major American cities. Some whites blamed black extremists such as Malcolm X. In July 1964, he said America would 'see a bloodbath' that summer. Harlem rioted days later. Riots in the Watts and Newark ghettos illustrate the causes of the riots.

# Watts - 1965

In the 1965 riots in Watts, Los Angeles, black mobs set fire to several blocks of stores, 34 died, 100 were injured, 3,500 looters and rioters were arrested and $40 million worth of damage was done to mostly white businesses. Why?

- Ghetto residents felt the end of segregation and the guarantee of voting rights in the South was no help to them. They wanted their grievances recognised. 
- King told the press that Watts was basically the revolt of an economic underclass.

# Newark - 1967

The Newark, New Jersey, riots in summer 1967 demonstrated the black antagonism to what many perceived as the 'occupying forces' of the white authorities that underlay many of the ghetto riots. In Newark:

- the underlying cause of the riots was poverty and deprivation
- some whites blamed the Black Power movement (the riots broke out the day after the announcement of plans for a Black Power conference in Newark) 
- the trigger was police brutality against a local cab driver
- snipers fired at white police officers
- families stole household goods from ruined stores
- black residents accused the National Guard and state troopers (called in by the city authorities and state governor) of indiscriminately shooting looters
- ï»¿over 20 died and hundreds were injured
- New Jersey Governor Richard Hughes described the riots as 'plain and simple crime' but the NAACP blamed poverty and slum life
- in 1970, Newark became the first major North- Eastern city to elect a black mayor, but ghetto conditions remained dire because white flight had eroded Newark's tax base.

President Johnson commissioned the Kerner Report on the widespread rioting. The report blamed: economic and social deprivation, oppressive white police officers, unsympathetic white authorities and recommended increased expenditure on the ghettos. That was unrealistic. Whites were tired of black protests and rioting and did not want to fund ghetto improvements during the expensive Vietnam War. In many ways, Northern whites bore responsibility for ghetto riots: they had contributed to the growth of large and impoverished black urban ghettos through: 

- violence and force, e.g. in 1951, several thousand working-class whites drove the sole black family out of Chicago's Cicero suburb by looting and burning
- devices such as restrictive covenants, e.g. 90 per cent of all Chicago housing after the Second World War was subject to covenants that limited sales and rentals to whites
- federal government policies, e.g. the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) rejected mortgage applications from non-whites and Jews, and the federal government was unwilling to build sufficient federal housing units for poor black Americans
- 'white flight' from the cities to the suburbs; e.g. in California, whites moved out of increasingly black Oakland into the nearby suburb of Hayward (white departures depleted a city's tax base so the ghettos grew even more rundown).

# Why now?

- People of the north were upset seeing south progress with little in north
- Domestic programme of the Great Society making people think Black people were a tax burden 
- Nasa, arms spending
- Vietnam
