# Black Panther history

- Established in October, 1966 by 24 year-old Huey Newton and 30 year-old Bobby Seale
- Paramilitary, berets and leather jackets
- "Power to the People", "The revolution has come it's time to pick up the gun"

- Manifesto included:
	- Federal government compensation to black Americans for the enslavement of their ancestors
	- freedom for incarcerated African-Americans, and black juries when black people were tried
	- black exemption from military service
	- a UN-supervised of black Americans "for the purpose of determining the will of black people as to their national destiny"
	- no police brutality 
	- improvements in ghetto living conditions 

- Never more than 5000 members
- 30 urban chapters in mostly west coast cities such as Oakland and Northern cities such as New York, Boston and Chicago
- Won respect in the ghettos, especially due to their emphasis on self-help: they set up ghetto clinics to advise on health, welfare and legal rights, and ran lessons to educate young people in their beliefs. 
- Provided childcare for working mothers and free food.
- ï»¿For example, in 1970 the Southern California chapter of the Free Breakfast programme served up over 1700 meals weekly 


- Citing the second amendment to the American Constitution (which said the citizens had the right to carry arms), armed Black Panthers followed police cars in the ghettos in order to expose police brutality. This led to some violent shoot-outs. In May 1967, Black Panthers surrounded and entered the California State Capital Building in Sacramento, accusing the legislature of considering repressive legislation. The Black Panthers routinely engaged in petty crime and sought confrontation with, and advocated the killing of, police officers. Not surprisingly, they were targeted and destroyed by the police and FBI during 1967-9.
- A 1970 poll revealed that 64 per cent of black Americans took pride in the Black Panthers, although Newton's biographer Hugh Pearson claimed they were little more than a temporary media phenomenon.
