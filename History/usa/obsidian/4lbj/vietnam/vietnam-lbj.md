> "The 1960s represent the most destructive period of a war that had its genesis in the 1940s and its final meltdown in the 1970s. Indeed, the Vietnam War was America in the 1960s. American society in the 1960s was not only affected by the war but completely and unalterably shaped by it. The Vietnam War ultimately destroyed America's place in the world, its faith in its leaders, its faith in governmental institutions, and ultimately, in faith itself." -John Robert Greene
