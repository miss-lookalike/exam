<br><br>
"

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did the Indian national Congress claim after the Amritsar massacre?
<br><br>
"	"That the British no longer possessed any moral authority to rule India

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What tactics did Gandhi use that meant the British couldn't win?

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When did the non-cooperation movement start
<br><br>
"	"1920
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

"What was the salt march?
<br><br>
"	"Salt made from the beaches of Dandi which broke the salt laws, which were in place to protect the government monopoly on salt as a non violent way of rebelling. Had mass participation, no longer confined to educated middle class

<br><br>

<br><br>
"

"	"Did not recommend full Indian self-government
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did Motilal Nehru do in 1926

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Who was encouraging uprisings in India
<br><br>
"	"The expatriate Indian population particularly in USA, Canada and Germany with help from the Irish Republic, Germany and Turkey. This caused strategic threats, as they may have been more likely to Ally with opposition to England.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When and why was Gandhi arrested?
<br><br>
"	"1930 due to the violence in the riots. He was released in February 1931 to talk with Viceroy Irwin at the roundtable conferences in London on the basis that he would stop the civil disobedience movement
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened at the round table conference?
<br><br>
"	"No room for princely states (as they favoured British rule) in gandhis vision for India, and no agreement was reached
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did Gandhi do after the round table conference?

<br><br>
"	"Now largely Indians, however a British governor could veto the provincial governments
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Why was the government of India act rejected?
<br><br>
"	"Congress sought full dominion status (the viceroy still had control of FP and defence) and the princely states feared a loss of their autonomy. They were refusing to accept concessions that weren't what they wanted.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"How could the movement be seen as weaker?
<br><br>
"	"Very strong divisions within the movement due to Muslims and Hindus. Gandhi was keen for India to stay united. However, Muslims want their own separate state, headed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Despite this, they were all still trying to have their own governing status, so it's still posed a great threat to the Empire
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did the 1936/7 elections for provincial governments and assemblies show?
<br><br>
"	"That Muslims were now voting for the Muslim league, and turning away from Congress. Congress still win 7 out of 11 provinces.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When was India granted independence?
<br><br>
"	"August 1947. This is very soon after the war, so it shows that the pre-war threats were very real.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened in the war that suggested Britain still had ultimate control over India
<br><br>
"	"The viceroy declared war on behalf of India. Although this shows Britain had full control - furthers resentment
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened as a result of Linlithgo declaration of war?
<br><br>
"	"Every member of Congress resigns, and Gandhi leads more civil disobedience. However, the all muslim league decide to support the war effort with aims to push for concessions afterwards.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the reason that the Indian nationalism post-World War I became much more clear cut and determined
<br><br>
"	"Jawaharlal Nehru had experience in European politics, and brought back the impact of socialism to India
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Why was the Middle East important to Britain?
<br><br>
"	"The Suez Canal, oil, and egyptian cotton so it had economic and strategic importance
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did Britain do during World War One throughout the Middle East
<br><br>
"	"Made several incoherent promises for short term gain that were intentionally vague so they could be pushed in British favour, however this wasn't always totally effective
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did Britain promised to Egypt during World War One
<br><br>
"	"Egyptian government if they were not disruptive
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the McMahon letter?
<br><br>
"	"1915 this was to the hashemites confirming favour of Arab nationalism
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What overall made the British period of dominance in the Middle East in the inter war period extremely difficult
<br><br>
"	"Conflicting ambitions of wanting to be the hegemonic power in the Middle East and the promises made to several nations combined with britain's already overstretched commitments worldwide
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What proportion of ships through the Suez Canal in the 1920s were British registered
<br><br>
"	"3/4
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Why was Egypt important
<br><br>
"	"The Suez Canal, prospective oil, and strategic location in the centre of the Middle East particularly in the 1930s because of the rise of fascism in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East, continuing importance of the cotton industry
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Until the 1950s what did Britain have in Egypt military wise
<br><br>
"	"The biggest RAF base in the world
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did the wafd appeal for in 1918
<br><br>
"	"Egyptian independence and they were influenced by president Wilson, and they did so at Versailles
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the demographic of the wafd
<br><br>
"	"They were dominated by landowning class and professionals. They were conservative nationalist party
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What does Curzon do in 1919
<br><br>
"	"In March 1919, he miscalculates the threat of the wafd and as Foreign Secretary orders a very harsh response to them campaigning for Egyptian independence. leading Members of the wafd were arrested and exiled.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened in Egypt after curzon's harsh response to the wafd
<br><br>
"	"It led to widespread unrest of riots and strikes in towns as well as sabotage of infrastructure
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did the British do during the uprisings in Egypt?
<br><br>
"	"They showed extreme violence and racial contempt. They killed around 1500 people in eight weeks and used the air force as it was cheaper and more effective. However, it was much more brutal. This showed that they were under significant threat to be using such extreme violence and again exposed the violence that they preached to not to partake in. This causes yet another rise in nationalism
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What concessions were made after the uprisings?
<br><br>
"	"General Allenby was brought in to deal with the situation and Wafd leaders who were exiled by curzon are brought back. He understood the Egyptians in a way curzon did not. his first concession was to release the wafd from prison
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the Milner report?
<br><br>
"	"1919, recommended conciliation in Egypt
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When was Egypt granted nominal independence?
<br><br>
"	"1922 under king fuad, who was anti wafd and pro British (because the waft challenged his position too). Britain retained control over defence, the canal and the Sudan, as well as keeping garrisons and the port of Alexandria
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Who did the wafd gain support from?
<br><br>
"	"Following the great uprisings and nominal independence, the wafd remained the dominant political group, gained support from poor people, as well as some terrorist cells on the fringes. This shows nationalism was now nationwide and no longer confined to the educated elite.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When were the arguments over Sudan?
<br><br>
"	"November 1924, and governor general sir Lee stack of the Sudan was assassinated in cairo
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When is there a fresh wave of wafd organised protest?
<br><br>
"	"1935 and there was also pressure from Mussolini's expansionism in the Mediterranean so a settlement was needed. Again, this shows how nationalism also posed strategic threat to Britain in the war.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the anglo-egyptian treaty?
<br><br>
"	"1936 full independence for Egypt, but Britain still retained control of the Suez Canal zone and garrisons an RAF bases in Egypt and the naval facilities Alexandria due to the fear of Italian aggression from Libya. Although independence being granted demonstrated that nationalist pressures were a significant threat ultimately Britain still retained its key interests prior to the second world war
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened to Egypt during World War Two
<br><br>
"	"In 1939 the Egyptian government were reluctant to declare war on Germany and king fuad was sympathetic to the axis powers. They were forced by the British in February 1942 pretty much at gunpoint to appoint mustafa al naha, the wafd leader as a Prime Minister as the wafd were now sympathetic to the allies. Demonstrated the extent of influence that Britain could still exert in Egypt
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What did Egypt remain as during World War Two
<br><br>
"	"An important strategic location for the British armed forces
<br><br>

<br><br>
"

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened to Iraq after World War One
<br><br>
"	"It became a British administered mandate of the League of Nations which disappointed hopes from Arab nationalists
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When were Kurdish uprisings in Iraq?
<br><br>
"	"1919 and 1920 revolt against British rule. the Kurdish uprising was crushed with extreme violence and at great cost of £40 million to the British. As in Egypt there was a use of air power because it was cheaper and believed to be an effective way to keep the peace and prevent uprisings but it only created further resentment
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was decided at the Cairo conference?
<br><br>
"	"1921 Iran granted self rule. This leads to the Anglo Iraqi treaty
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the 1922 Anglo Iraqi treaty?
<br><br>
"	"1922 King Faisal I (of the Hashemite dynasty) is confirmed as the king of Iraq. Britain retained control of foreign policy and defence and maintained armed forces in the country, and the economic interests in oil remained
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When do the kirkuk oil fields open
<br><br>
"	"In 1927. They are run by Turkish oil company but financed by Britain and France and actually has nothing to do with Turkey
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was the 1930 Anglo Iraqi treaty
<br><br>
"	"Consultation between Iraq and Britain on foreign policy, but British mandate had officially ended and king Faisal died too
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When does Iraq gain full independence?
<br><br>
"	"1932, although Britain retained much influence through the dominance of the British oil industry, and the RAF retained airbases in the country. This suggests that Iraqi nationalism wasn't much of a threat to the British empire, because once they gained their demands, Britain still had influence.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What happened in 1941 in Iraq
<br><br>
"	"There was a British occupation of Basra in the South in which the Iraqi government asked for help from the axis powers and there was a six week campaign to restore British rule over Iraq. This demonstrated they could still assert their dominance despite Iraq technically being independent
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What was Iraqi opinion like by World War Two
<br><br>
"	"It was increasingly anti British because of how they were behaving not only in Iraq but also in Palestine
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"When is it decided that Iran can be self ruled
<br><br>
"	"In 1921 at the Cairo conference
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"Quote for James about British dominance in the Middle East
<br><br>
"	"'Britain was still the dominant power [in the Middle East] and would go to any lengths to get its way there'
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"James opinion on British dominance in Middle East
<br><br>
"	"The coup de main in 1941 against Iraq and the palace coup in Cairo nine months later demonstrated that British power was still firm 'despite over 20 years of nationalist ferment'. However these were both actions undertaken in the face of dire emergency by a country fighting for its life
<br><br>
