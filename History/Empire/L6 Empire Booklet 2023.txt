Introduction: The British Empire, 1857 - 1967
We live in a world that empires have made. Indeed, most of the modern world is the relic of empires:
colonial and pre-colonial, African, Asian, European and American. Its history and culture is riddled with
the memories, aspirations, institutions and grievances left behind by those empires. The largest if not
the grandest of these was the empire laboriously assembled by the British across more than three
centuries. No less than one quarter of today’s sovereign states were hewn from its fabric. For that
reason alone, its impact was second to none.

Guide to essay writing at A -Level:
The essay is the basic form of expressing yourself as an historian. An essay is, essentially, an argument
which argues a case in response to a specific question. It is not simply a factual account or a narrative
of events.
1. Read The Question Carefully:
Read the question carefully and identify the key terms. Be clear what the question is asking you and
note whether the question gives any dates that you need to focus on. The nature of the question can
help you decide your structure.
2. Reading:
Once you understand the question, you then need to go through the information that might help you
answer it. Look back through your notes carefully and pick out material that might be relevant. This
might also be the time to do some selective reading if there are any gaps in your notes or areas you
want to develop. As you read, always have the essay question in the back of your mind.
3. Planning:
Once you have all the material you need, you need to write a plan. Planning your essay is essential –
you need to know what you are going to say and how you are going to say it before you start writing
your final essay. This takes time and Sixth Formers are often reluctant to do it but it really helps to
ensure that your final essay is effective. If necessary, you may need to do a bit more reading at this
stage
4. Introduction:
Your introduction is one of the most important and complex parts of the essay. Your introduction
should not set the scene (you are not writing a novel) but should directly address the question and set
out what you are going to argue. You (and the reader) should know where the essay is going from the
outset; the reader should be able to work out the essence of your argument simply by reading the
introduction. In summary, an introduction needs to do the following things:
-

Define the terms of the question and deal with any ambiguous terms/ concepts etc. – don’t
let the question push you around!
Outline what the debate in the question is.
Outline what you are going to argue in your essay.
5. Structure:

There is a range of ways of structuring an essay. However, there are two common approached that
you can often use at A-Level, depending on what the question is:
‘Factors’ Essay – this is often used in answering causation or consequence questions. The question will
state a factor and ask you to consider how important it was. For example, the question could ask
whether X was the most important cause of Y. You would need to consider the importance of X (the

~9~

stated factor) in your first paragraph, followed by a range of other factors in other paragraphs. (If you
don’t think X is the most important factor, your second paragraph should explain what is):
-

Introduction
First Paragraph – explain the importance of the stated factor
Second Paragraph – explain the most important factor (if not X)
Further Paragraphs – explain the importance of other factors
Conclusion

‘Two Sides’ Essay – this is slightly more straightforward and can be used if the question asks you to
assess the successes/ failures of something, or for other questions that simply offer a binary yes/ no
answer:
-

Introduction
First few Paragraphs – deal with the points supporting one side of the argument
Final few Paragraphs – deal with the points supporting the other side of the argument
Conclusion
6. Paragraphs:

A paragraph should mark a stage in your argument and should itself be structured carefully. The most
effective paragraphs have the following straightforward structure:
-

Point – the first sentence (sometimes called a ‘topic sentence’) makes the point that the
paragraph is making.
Evidence – the next few sentences give detailed factual evidence to support the point the
paragraph is making.
Analysis – link the paragraph (the point) back to the overall question and explain the
significance of the point you have made.

When planning your essay, it is often a good idea to write down the first sentence of each paragraph
so that you have an outline – you can then develop each one later.
7. Conclusion:
This needs to sum up your overall argument and explain, in summary, how the different th reads of
your essay fit together. The conclusion needs to be consistent with your introduction and everything
else that has gone before. At the top end, conclusions also help put the question into a wider context
and hint at other questions that have been raised. Conclusions are difficult to write and you will
improve as you move through the Sixth Form. Ensure, though, that you leave plenty of time to write
your conclusion and don’t rush it.
8. Proof Reading:
Once you have written your essay, proof read it to ensure that it makes sense and that the spelling,
grammar and punctuation are accurate. If necessary, ask someone else to help you.

Style Guide:
Clarity
This is the most important aspect of any piece of writing. If it is not clear what point you are making,
the essay or paragraph needs rewriting. Reread sections that you have completed. If you are unsure
what they mean, somebody else will be too. Ask other people to read sections and get them to explain
back to you what they think you are trying to say. If they are unsure, you need to make some changes.
Precision
You need to ensure that you sound as though you know what you are talking about. To do this, you
need to be precise in the points you make. For example, rather than saying ‘British rule expanded in
Africa over many years’, be precise about the dates of his reign. Give dates, names and specific
examples as much as you can.
Concision
Try to make your point in as few words as possible. Avoid tautology (‘the ice was frozen’) and don’t
try to ‘pad’ sentences out with superfluous words. In addition, don’t try to sound clever by using long
words when a perfectly good short one would do as this will affect the clarity of your writing.
Formality
Ensure that you always use formal English in your essay. Avoid slang and colloquialisms and also avoid
hackneyed phrases (‘The British bit off more than he could chew’). Certainly avoid gratuitous abuse
(‘Cecil Rhodes was a complete idiot’) as this will detract from any serious analysis. In addition, avoid
using contractions (‘could have’ rather than ‘could’ve’). Avoid using acronyms that aren’t in common
currency (e.g. don’t use ‘S.F.A.’ in place of the Scramble for Africa).
Avoid use of the first person
The first person makes the essay sound less formal and you can still express your own view without
using it. For example: ‘William Gladstone was largely motivated by moral concerns’ is a clear
expression of your view and there is no need to rephrase it as ‘I believe that William Gladstone was
largely motivated by moral concerns.’ The former is obviously your opinion as you are the one writing
the essay and making the argument!
Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation
Ensure that you check spelling, grammar and punctuation carefully. Don’t just rely on spell check as
this frequently gets things wrong (particularly when dealing with foreign names or words). In addition,
check that you have capitalised all proper nouns. It is well worth asking a tolerant friend or parent to
read your essay through to check it for any errors.

~ 11 ~

When to use quotations from historians in an essay:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Don’t just chuck them in for no reason or to pad out your paragraph. They need to serve a
particular purpose.
Avoid including quotations that just refer to factual information (unless it is particularly
obscure and only that historian mentions it).
Instead, you should look for the historians’ opinions and argume nts, whether they agree with
your perspective or not.
You can also include quotations when they put a point in a particularly pithy and memorable
way.
Try to keep quotations as short as you can
Integrate quotations into the flow of your own writing – they should sound as if they naturally
fit into your paragraph
Think about whether a paraphrase of the historians’ view would work better than a quotation
Always reference a historian’s view whether it is a quotation or a paraphrase to avoid
plagiarism

~ 12 ~

Guide to answering interpretations questions:
The phrasing of the question will always be:
‘Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments in these
extracts are in relation to…[issue/ theme linked to a key question of the specification]’
•
•
•

There will always be a range of interpretations.
They will collectively cover a theme/ issue spanning a 20-30 year period (individual extracts
may be more focused).
Engage with each interpretation in turn – essentially three separate exercises.

Structure of answer/ analysis of each interpretation:
1. Comprehension:
• Identify in summary the overall argument – one point
• 3 points to identify the supporting points/ arguments that show how the author comes
to their interpretation
o
o
o

‘The main argument of X is…’
‘X supports this claim by arguing…’
‘In addition, they argue…’

2. Challenge/ Corroboration using own knowledge:
❖ 5 points from your own knowledge that either corroborate or challenge the
interpretation (or parts of the interpretation) given in the extract
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o

‘X is most convincing in their claim that… because, it is clear that…’
‘X is astute to identify that…’
‘X is correct to identify that…’
‘X is correct to mention’
‘X’s assertion that… is convincing because…’
‘However, what is less convincing about X’s argument is…’
‘X neglects to mention…’
‘X could emphasise more…’
‘X is incorrect to emphasise…’
‘X is incorrect to suggest…

3. Reach a judgement on the interpretation:
o

‘Therefore, X’s arguments are relatively (un)convincing, although their claim
that… is perhaps too emphatic/ not emphatic enough. Overall, this is the
most/least convincing argument of the three extracts.’

4. Repeat the process for the other two interpretations

Bibliography :
At Sixth Form, you are expected to be more independent in your studies. A large proportion of your
time should be spent reading around the subject to enhance and consolidate your knowledge. Indeed,
if you are aiming for an A or an A* it is essential that you read widely and don’t just rely on your basic
textbook or the information you get in lessons. Fortunately, there is a wealth of excellent historical
writing on the British Empire:
General academic surveys of the British Empire – asterisked books are ‘key texts’ - particularly
recommended or required reading and there are multiple copies within the department.
❖ *Bernard Porter The Lion’s Share (5th edn.) (Pearson; 2012)
o An excellent narrative of Britain’s imperial story from 1850 to the
present. Particularly good on explaining the international
economic and geopolitical context.

❖ *Lawrence James The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (Abacus; 1995)
o Covers the whole of the British Empire from c. 1600 – the latter
sections will be more useful for this course. A good narrative with
a focus on the domestic impact of empire in Britain, as well as
events overseas.

❖ Niall Ferguson Empire (Penguin; 2004)
o A controversial book that accompanied a TV series. His central
thesis is that British imperialism produced most of the concepts
and values that shape the modern world – a positive gloss on the
imperial story.

❖ Denis Judd Empire: The British Imperial Experience from 1765 to the
Present (IB Tauris; 2011)
o An engaging narrative of the empire from the eighteenth
century, taking as its structure a series of defining moments that
convey the essence of the imperial period.

~ 14 ~

❖ John Darwin The Empire Project (Cambridge; 2011)
o A detailed look at the main components of empire from the
1830s to decolonisation. A key feature of this book is the
importance it gives to the impact of Britain’s geopolitical
position.

❖ *John Darwin Unfinished Empire (Penguin; 2013)
o A superb look at British imperial history from a thematic
perspective. Darwin is excellent at identifying what is important
in such a vast and potentially confusing topic.

❖ Philippa Levine The British Empire (2nd edn.) (Routledge; 2013)
o A brief thematic look at key aspects of imperial history

❖ PJ Marshall Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire
o A good narrative overview followed by chapters covering various
important themes by different authors.

❖ The Oxford History of the British Empire (volumes III and IV), edited by
WM Roger Louis (Oxford; 2001)
o A collection of essays covering all aspects of the empire. Volume
III focuses on the 19th century, while volume IV focuses on the
20th century. They are an essential companion for serious
academic study of this topic.

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography is available online through the school
library and has accounts of the lives of all significant individuals covered in this course.

~ 15 ~

❖ Ashley Jackson The British Empire: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford; 2013)
o Part of the Very Short Introduction series – this does what it says on
the tin and gives a helpful orientation to the topic. Available online
through the school library website.

More specialised texts:
The study of the British Empire incorporates the study of a very large number of countries in the world
today. There are more specialist works available on India, or parts of Africa, as well as other regions.
The history department and library have a selection of resources – please do ask Mr Grant for further
details.
On wider context:
The following are useful if you want to broaden your knowledge of the period. If you are thinking of
applying to read History at university, you might benefit from looking at the following:
❖ David Cannadine Victorious Century (Penguin; 2018)
o An overview narrative of British history in the 19th Century
❖ Peter Clarke Hope and Glory (Penguin; 2004)
o An overview narrative of British history in the 20 Century
❖ John Darwin After Tamerlane (Penguin; 2008)
o A compelling account of the rise and fall of global empires since c. 1400 – an
excellent introduction to world history

Podcasts:
Podcasts are a fantastic way to give you an overview or a greater understanding of unfamiliar topics.
Some of the best are as follows:
The Rest is History: Historians Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook are
interrogating the past, attempting to de-tangle the present for their new
podcast "The Rest Is History". They question the nature of Greatness, why the West
no longer has civil wars and whether Richard Nixon was more like Caligula or
Claudius. They're distilling the entirety of human history, or, as much as they can fit
into about thirty minutes.
HistoryExtra podcast episodes are released every week, featuring interviews with
notable historians on topics spanning ancient history through to recent British to
American events. Episodes feature history stories and perspectives on everything
from crusading knights to Tudor monarchs and the D-Day landings.

Empire: How do empires rise? Why do they fall? And how have they shaped the
world around us today? William Dalrymple and Anita Anand explore the stories,
personalities and events of empire over the course of history. The first series looks
at the British in India, covering the East India Company, the Raj, Gandhi,
Independence and Partition.

In Our Time (Radio 4): The legendary broadcaster, Melvyn Bragg, chairs a regular
discussion about a matter of academic interest on Radio 4. The back catalogue is
available as podcasts online – many of them have a historical theme and some, such
as that on the Indian Mutiny, are directly relevant to our course.

Overture: The Opium Wars
Canton (Guangzhou) is a city on the southern coast of China. By the 1830s several European countries
had established small trading outposts (‘factories’) there, but these were limited to a small area on
the river-front; the Chinese emperors were reluctant to open up their countries more widely to
European trade and the interior of China was closed off to European trade and influence .
The British were enthusiastic participants in the trade through Canton; the British bought tea from the
Chinese (worth £2 million a year), and sold various products in return. One of the most lucrative
products that the British sold was opium which the Chinese market bought in vast quantities in
exchange for silver.
Opium is an addictive drug that causes physical and mental deterioration in those who smoke it and
its use by the Chinese had grown enormously. British traders grew it in India (a British possession),
and, by the 1830s, it amounted to around 40% of India’s exports.
The Chinese authorities were hostile to European traders, belie ving them to be uncivilised, and in 1839
Chinese Emperor Daoguang tried to crack down on the opium trade in his country. He sent a
commissioner to Canton who executed numerous addicts and raided the European trading outposts.
There were skirmishes between Chinese and British ships and this was used by the British as a casus
belli for war.
Many British viewed the Chinese as backward and uncivilised, and believed that it was Britain’s
responsibility to bring ‘civilisation’ and the benefits of free trade to China. The British Prime Minister,
Lord Palmerston, believed that to defend British honour and assert the principles of free trade, military
action had to be taken.
The British sent the warship Nemesis, a
630 ton paddle-steamer, to China. It was
capable of sailing inland up rivers and
devastated Chinese defences. The
Chinese, defending with bows and
arrows, rusty cannon, and monkeys with
explosives strapped to them, faced little
chance and, in 1842, the Treaty of
Nanking was imposed on China.
This treaty gave large amounts of
compensation to the British opium
traders, guaranteed British trading access to five Chinese ports (the ‘Treaty Ports’, which included
Canton and Shanghai), and the British also gained sovereignty over the island of Hong Kong which
quickly became a naval and trading hub off the south coast of China. The Treaty of Nanking confirmed
to Europeans that China was an empire in perpetual decline.
In 1856 another conflict (the ‘Second Opium War’) erupted after the Chinese authorities seized a
British-registered ship The Arrow which they suspected of piracy. Palmerston again responded with
military force; a European army was assembled and, in 1860, this marched to Beijing. The Chinese
were humiliated and the Emperor’s beautiful Summer Palace was sacked. The subsequent treaties

~ 19 ~

forced the Chinese to legalise the opium trade, opened further treaty ports to Europeans, and allowed
Europeans to trade inland too. In the words of the time, an ‘open door policy’ was forced upon China.
Responses to these events in Britain were varied. Many supported Palmerston’s robust action and
believed that the British were firmly in the right. However, there was also shock at the destruction of
the Summer Palace and there were some who doubted Britain’s claim to moral superiority. The Liberal
politician, William Gladstone, argued that a war in defence of the opium trade covered the entire
country in disgrace. The celebrated Head Master of Rugby School, Thomas Arnold, claimed that Britain
had committed ‘a national sin of the greatest possible magnitude’. Nevertheless, European
commercial dominance in China (and British possession of Hong Kong) would remain an important
geopolitical reality until well into the 20th Century.

The sequence of events that make up the opium wars introduce us to several important themes in
British imperialism in the 19th century:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The central importance of free trade and commercial advantage
The use of naval force and superior technology to exploit the relative weakness of nonEuropean powers
The conquest of territory and the establishment of direct rule (but as a least-preferred
option)
The importance attached to ‘informal empire’ and spheres of influence
Hypocrisy and the assumed superiority of British civilisation, alongside the racial contempt
for non-European societies
The empire as a cause of controversy and debate within Britain itself

Context: The British Empire before 1850s
Britain had a considerable formal empire in the 1850s. It had little to do with her contemporary needs
and interests, having been inherited from a previous age when those interests were different. The
British West Indies had their origin in a now defunct system of Atlantic trade and a few long-forgotten
naval victories. Canada had been secured for Britain by a famous battle in 1759 which the British would
probably not have bothered to fight 100 years later. Australia had been taken in the late eighteenth
century with less fuss than Canada, mainly because no one else wanted it. The European settlement
in South Africa originated in a musty religious quarrel of 200 years before, which few remembered
now except the settlers themselves. British India had come into being through an earlier manifestation
of ‘creeping imperialism’, and the cavalier empire-building of a few freelance adventurers… in the
eighteenth century. Other colonies had come as booty from the French revolutionary and Napoleonic
wars. These were the largest units of the old empire. It was not a negligible inheritance. The formal
empire posed a constant dilemma to the mid-Victorians. At the time it had been seized it had seemed
like a good idea, but now it was difficult to justify it from anyone’s point of view.

B Porter, The Lion’s Share (5th edition), 2012

‘First’ to ‘Second’ British Empire
The British Empire originated in the 16th Century activities of explorers and traders; it was largely a
private affair in search of profits and adventure, with little government involvement. In 1497, under
royal patronage, John Cabot had discovered Newfoundland but attempts during the reign of Elizabeth
I to colonise areas of North America ended in failure.
In 1607 the Virginia Company established at Jamestown the first permanent English colony in North
America. In 1624 it came under direct royal jurisdiction. Thereafter, the English colonial presence
expanded along the eastern seaboard of North America in a series of colonies.
This ‘first’ British Empire was
centred on the Atlantic.
Migrants from the British Isles
settled in colonies on the
mainland. Moreover, parts of
the West Indies were also
colonised and these became
lucrative territories, supplying
sugar, tobacco and cotton.
Slavery was a key component of
this empire and much of Britain’s
wealth
rested
on
the
exploitation of enslaved Africans
who were shipped across to the
West Indies.

~ 24 ~

Britain also became active in areas away from the Atlantic; the East India Company (founded 1600)
established trade with India and other parts of Asia where it competed with similar compan ies from
other European powers. The Seven Years War, which ended in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, saw
significant expansion of Britain’s overseas empire at the expense of France in Canada and India.
In 1776, however, thirteen of Britain’s North American colonies declared independence and, following
a war, their independence was recognised by Britain in 1783. The United States was now a rival and
Britain’s dominance of the Atlantic was diminished significantly.
A humanitarian campaign to abolish the slave trade was successful in 1807 (slavery itself being
abolished in 1834) and this further lessened the importance of the Atlantic. While Atlantic trade
remained important, the early Nineteenth Century saw a ‘swing to the east’ as India became the focus
of British expansion in what would be termed a ‘second British Empire’.

Britain by the mid-19th Century
Britain was the first country in the world to industrialise and, by the 1850s, Britain’s economy was
growing rapidly and it dominated world trade. The prosperity of Britain, as well as its military might,
made it the greatest power in this period.
Furthermore, Britain also had a unique political system which helped ensure stability; from the 17 th
Century Britain had inherited a parliamentary system of government which upheld the rule of law, as
well as important freedoms. Britain, while not yet a democracy, had much more liberal political
climate than most of its European rivals. The monarchy was a largely symbolic institution, although no
less significant for that, and it took on a new, unifying role as the Victorian empire expanded.

Migration & the colonies of settlement
Movement of people as well as goods was a very important feature of the imperial experience.
Between the 1850s and the First World War over 20 million people left the British Isles (emigrated) to
live permanently overseas; primarily these were economic migrants who sought new opportunities. A
very large number of these went to the United States but a significant number also went to Britain’s
colonies of settlement: Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
In the 18th century the most important colonies of settlement were on the eastern seaboard of what
would later become the United States. The mismanagement of these thirteen colonies by the British
government helped cause the colonies to declare their independence in 1776; the resulting American
War of Independence led to a humiliating withdrawal of British authority and the birth of a new rival
power.
Stung by the American experience, over the course of the 19 th century, the remaining colonies of
settlement became largely self-governing in relation to domestic matters; the British did not want to
risk causing resentment through interference in local matters which could have led to complete
separation. After a rebellion in Canada in 1837, the Durham Report recommended the introduction of
‘responsible government’. Canada became federated and self-governing in 1867 and was the blueprint
for all other ‘white’ settler colonies.
Devolution of decision-making to local representative assemblies and politicians paradoxically
strengthened the remaining bonds with Britain. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa
remained part of the empire and ultimate political authority remained in London, especially when it
came to matters of foreign policy and defence, and also when it came to protecting the rights o f the
local indigenous populations. Throughout the 19th century the settlers in these colonies generally
regarded themselves as ‘British’ and retained close ties to the ‘mother’ country where they usually
still had relatives (see extract from Darwin below). (The exceptions to this sense of British identity
were the French-speaking Quebecois population in Canada and the Boer population in South Africa).
Emigration from Britain was an extremely important dimension of British ‘cultural imperialism’ in the
late 19th Century and early 20th Century as the English language and British political and cultural
practices were spread overseas.

‘Among the ethnic British majorities in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland, and the
large ‘English’ minority among South African whites, a sense of shared British identity (to be sharply
distinguished from any subservience to Britain) was deeply ingrained. Dominion politicians declared
over and over again that Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland were ‘British countries’
or ‘British nations’. To them and their constituents, the ‘Empire’ was not an alien overlord, but a joint
enterprise in which they were, or claimed to be, partners.’

International Relations and Strategic Threats
Between 1857 and 1967 the international situation and balance of power changed enormously. In the
1850s Britain’s main rivals in the mid-19th Century were:
•
•

France
Russia

Germany and Italy were not unified countries until 1870 and 1871 respectively. Therefore, they were
not yet rivals. (Towards the end of the 19th Century they became much more significant powers). The
USA was still focused on its own development and expansion westwards – it had little interest in affairs
outside its hemisphere and in the 1860s would be preoccupied with its own civil war. Japan only
started opening up to the world and developing as a modern world power from 1868 onwards.
The main potential areas of tension with other powers were therefore:
•
•
•

The ‘Great Game’ with Russia – North West Frontier and the importance of Afghanistan
The route to India – the Cape of Good Hope, the Mediterranean, Suez and the importance of
the Ottoman Empire
The lengthy Canadian land border with the USA (this was settled in a series of agreements
throughout the 19th Century)

Potential areas of tension:
•
•

Africa – largely unexplored by Europeans in the mid-19th Century
China – declining as an empire and vulnerable to incursions from European powers

Both of these areas saw intense competition in a series of ‘scrambles’ in the late 19 th Century.
Concert of Europe:
Since the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Europe had largely been at peace. The great powers of Europe
(The UK, France, Prussia, Russia and Austria) had regularly met at Congresses to settle disputes
between them and resolve tensions. The only significant conflict between 1815 and 1870 was the
Crimean War (1853-1856) in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance comprised of Britain, France
and the Ottoman Empire. Pax Britannica is the name often given to the 1815-1914 period as the British
were the hegemonic power and there were few serious conflicts between the great powers of the
world.

Britain’s conversion to free trade in the 1840s coincided with a determined effort to open up new
markets. The volume of Britain’s overseas trade had expanded steadily since 1815. The largest outlets
were Europe and the United States, which together accounted for two-thirds of the £50 million earned
by exports in 1827. This pattern continued for the next forty years. In 1867, when Britain’s exports
totalled £181 million, goods sold in countries outside the empire accounted for £131 million. There
had been expansion everywhere, most spectacularly in South America where, in 1867, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Peru imported products worth just over £12 million.
-

Lawrence James, The British Empire

What do these details suggest about the importance of direct control of overseas territory to
Britain’s trade and commerce?

Had the conversion to free trade made empire redundant? In the Western world, the answer might
have been ‘nearly, but not quite.’ By the mid nineteenth century, the British West Indies had become
a commercial backwater, left behind by lower-cost sugar producers such as Brazil, Cuba and Java. The
United States had become Britain’s greatest trade partner (in the nineteenth century Britain’s imports
from the US usually exceeded in value its whole trade with Asia) . Its slave South produced the raw
cotton that fed Lancashire’s mills, the source of Britain’s largest and most valuable export up to 1914,
cotton cloth… Indeed Liverpool lived by American trade…From the merchants’ point of view, the illfeeling aroused by the relics of imperial power in North America… made empire an encumbrance to
commerce, not an aid.

What does Darwin argue about the importance of empire to Britain’s commerce?

~ 35 ~

Informal Empire
To focus solely on colonial possessions in examining Britain’s expansion overseas in the nineteenth
century is to ignore the multifaceted nature of Britain’s international position. The increases in foreign
trade, in the balance of credit abroad, and in the numbers of emigrants settling overseas in these years
were but part of a wide-ranging expansion of British society that also took military, naval, religious,
and cultural forms and spread far beyond the territorial holdings of Britain’s Empire. The naval officer
in the Atlantic, the missionary in Africa, and the trader in China were as much agents of potential
British influence as the colonial administrator in India. Yet the nature and significance of this influence,
its impact, and the British government’s role in sustaining it remain elusive.

Historiography: The Imperialism of Free Trade
The traditional view of Britain’s empire in the
19th Century was that the mid-Victorian period
marked an ‘era of indifference’ to empire and
that the late 19th Century marked an ‘era of
imperialism’; that the mid-century was ‘antiimperialist’ but that the late-century saw
‘enthusiasm’ for empire; that free trade made
formal control of colonies obsolete but that,
towards the end of the century, there was a
marked change in policy towards formal
annexation of territory as the ‘scramble for
Africa’ got underway. Thus, in the traditional
view, there was a significant discontinuity in
Victorian imperial policy. This view saw a clear
difference between geographical areas under
formal control (marked red on the map) and
those where there was a more informal economic influence.
Certainly there were fewer annexations in the mid-19th Century, politicians in Britain rarely advocated
annexation of territory (Benjamin Disraeli called colonies ‘millstones round our necks’), and in the
1860s there was even a proposal to withdraw from Britain’s West African colonies. By contrast, the
1880s and 1890s saw enormous swathes of Africa annexed, as well as parts of Asia.
However, in 1953 Professors John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson published a seminal article entitled
‘The Imperialism of Free Trade’ which overhauled the traditional ‘discontinuity’ thesis. In its place,
they argued for a basic continuity in Britain’s imperial policy and that much less of a distinction should
be made between the formal empire (coloured red) and the informal empire.
Gallagher and Robinson argued that ‘the conventional view of Victorian imperial history leaves us with
a series of awkward questions. In the age of' anti-imperialism' why were all colonies retained? Why
were so many more obtained? Why were so many new spheres of influence set up? Or again, in the
age of 'imperialism', as we shall see later, why was there such reluctance to annex further territory?
Why did decentralization, begun under the impetus of anti-imperialism, continue? In the age of laissezfaire why was the Indian economy developed by the state?’ In the mid-Victorian period, Britain
retained and expanded its position in India and no colonies were actually surrendered. By contrast, in
the later period, British politicians always formally annexed territory only as a last resort, and there
was always reluctance in London to take on more territory.
Instead, Gallagher and Robinson argued that ‘a concept of informal empire which fails to bring out the
underlying unity between it and the formal empire is sterile.’ Instead, ‘throughout, British governments
worked to establish and maintain British paramountcy by whatever means best suited the
circumstances of their diverse regions of interest. The aims of the mid- Victorians were no more 'antiimperialist' than their successors', though they were more often able to achieve them informally; and
the late- Victorians were no more 'imperialist' than their predecessors, even though they were driven
to annex more often. British policy followed the principle of extending control informally if possible and

~ 37 ~

formally if necessary. To label the one method 'anti-imperialist' and the other 'imperialist', is to ignore
the fact that whatever the method British interests were steadily safeguarded and extended. The usual
summing up of the policy of the free trade empire as 'trade not rule' should read 'trade with informal
control if possible; trade with rule when necessary'.’
‘One principle then emerges plainly: it is only when and where informal political means failed to provide
the framework of security for British enterprise (whether commercial, or philanthropic or simply
strategic) that the question of establishing formal empire arose. In satellite regions peopled by
European stock, in Latin America or Canada, for instance, strong governmental structures grew up; in
totally non-European areas, on the other hand, expansion unleashed such disruptive forces upon the
indigenous structures that they tended to wear out and even collapse with use. This tendency in many
cases accounts for the extension of in- formal British responsibility and eventually for the change from
indirect to direct control. It was in Africa that this process of transition manifested itself most strikingly
during the period after I880.’

In the mid-nineteenth century British economic and political influence overseas expanded
considerably. Latin America, China, the Ottoman Empire, and Africa experienced growing British
involvement, economic, political and military. The theme of these years is of a Britain attempting to
negotiate relationships with such societies to her own benefit, with the free trade treaty playing a
central role. At its simplest, the aim was thereby to increase British economic interests in that region,
although in some cases this underpinned strategic ambitions… In the mid-nineteenth century such
linkages with these regions as successive British governments did achieve through the promotion of
free trade are less impressive, in retrospect, than they might initially appear. There are conceptual
limitations in using metaphors such as ‘informal empire’ or ‘informal control’ to understand Britain’s
relations with these areas. The metaphors not only distort what should be seen as a more ambiguous,
fluid and infinitely graded continuum of influence between Britain and the wider world.

Informal and Formal Empire in the Nineteenth Century

https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/formal-and-informal-empire-inthe-nineteenth-century

European priorities were always economic. The experience of colonial revolutions and wars of
independence since the mid-eighteenth century made European states reluctant to acquire new
colonial possessions. Even in 1860 many parts of the globe, particularly in Africa, were still
uncolonised. Yet the drastically changed balance of power between Europe and other parts of the
world, following on the development of industry, the military reorganization of the European states
during the wars of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the beginnings of decline
and disintegration in some of the great non-European empires, the Ottoman, Mughal and Chinese
empires in particular, made it easy for European states to gain territories overseas. The imperative
here was trade: not exclusive mercantilist controls any more, but the opening up of new markets in a
world of free trade dominated by British maritime supremacy. There was no ideological drive to
acquire territory, but again and again, the disruptive effects of European trade, exploration and
missionary activity on indigenous societies and political systems caused conflict and led European
states to recover their prestige and secure their economic interests by intervening, in many cases
leading to outright annexation or at the very least behind-the-scenes control. The whole process was
haphazard and there was no idea that colonial and imperial policy would be governed by international
agreement.

Context – The East India Company and rule up to 1857
Today India is an independent country.
However, the area that the British once ruled
actually covered not just today’s India, but also
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and, for a time,
Burma. This is an enormous area and it is
perhaps more helpful to think of ‘India’ as a
subcontinent rather than a single ‘country’ as
this word conveys more of a sense of its
enormity and diversity.
The Mughal Empire
Between the Fifteenth and Eighteenth
Centuries, the dominant power in India was the
Mughal Empire. The first Mughal Emperor was
Akbar the Great who came to power in 1556
and he managed to unite most of the disparate Indian states. He established his capital at Delhi where he
constructed the famous Red Fort from where he ruled over his expanding empire. The Mughals were
Muslim and enforced Persian as the official language on their Indian subjects. Under the Mughals, Islam
became an important cultural force throughout the sub-continent and many people, particularly poorer
people, converted to Islam to escape their low status in Hindu caste society. The North West and the East
(Bengal) became Muslim-majority areas.
However, most Indians continued to be Hindus and the Mughals were tolerant enough to allow them to
continue practising their religion freely. Although the Emperor was in ultimate authority, powerful Muslims
never formed more than a privileged elite. Most of India was divided into smaller kingdoms and
principalities, each ruled over by local Hindu kings and princes who, in turn, paid homage to the Mughal
Emperor.
In the Sixteenth Century, the Mughal Emperors encouraged the growth of a separate religious movement
called Sikhism which fused elements of Hinduism and Islam. This religion centred on the holy city of
Amritsar in the Punjab in North-West India. Sikh leaders developed a distinct identity for their religious
group with a militant attitude and military discipline.
The Mughals reached the peak of their power under the rule of Emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658) who
became famous for constructing the Taj Mahal. The Mughal Empire became well known as a place of great
literature, architecture and religious tolerance.
However, although their position was secure in the north, the Mughals never consolidated their rule in the
south of the country. The repeated attempts to wage war required constant taxation and this eventually
wore down the will of both rulers and ruled. From the time of Emperor Aurangzeb (d. 1707), the Mughal
Empire started to shrink.
Into this power vacuum moved a Hindu group known as the Marathas who expanded their influence in the
south and centre of India. Under occasionally brilliant leadership, the Marathas were able to control a large
part of the country and rejected the authority of the Mughal Emperors in Delhi. However, the Marathas
were never able to consolidate their territory into a proper state and the ‘Maratha Confederacy’ was really

~ 44 ~

just a loose collection of warlords. They were relatively poor and found it difficult to sustain large-scale
armies. This meant that, by the Seventeenth Century, India was politically fragmented.
By this point, Europeans had started to arrive to trade with India. In particular, they were interested in
exporting spices, cotton and silks. The political instability was a mixed blessing for the European traders;
on the one hand, it meant that the security of their trading interests was subject to political volatility and
insecurity. On the other hand, it meant that there was a vacuum of authority to take advantage of.
•

What were India’s vulnerabilities in the late Mughal period?

The Rise of the East India Company
The East India Company was set up during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. It started trading in India in 1612
and made deals with the local Indian rulers. The Company set up a number of trading posts along the Indian
coast. Its largest bases were in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. It became a very powerful company and,
because of the political turmoil within India, had its own army to defend its interests.

~ 45 ~

Other European powers also set up rival companies. The most important rival was France which, in 1756,
allied with the Indian Nawab (ruler) of Bengal against the British East India Company. During the Seven
Years War between Britain and France (1756-63), the Nawab attacked the East India Company’s Fort
William in Calcutta. He imprisoned a number of British men, women and children who perished in a cell
which became known as the black hole of Calcutta.
In response to this, the British sent Colonel Robert Clive to defeat the Nawab of Bengal. He achieved a
major victory over the Nawab’s forces at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. This gave the East India Company
control over the large territory of Bengal; the British conquest of India had started. From this point
onwards, the other European powers were not in a position to challenge the British.
East India Company rule in India:
Gradually, the East India Company increased its control over more and more Indian territory. Sometimes
they would use their army to take land by force. However, on many occasions they simply played other
Indian rulers off against each other or bribed Indian rulers to hand over their territory. Following the India
Act of 1774 the British government possessed the legal powers to guide the EIC in the administration of
India. In 1784 an Indian Board of Control was set up in London to supervise Indian affairs. The British
Government nominated the Governor-General who headed the Company regime in Calcutta (Simla in the
hot summer months). The Company Army became a formidable force, staffed with British officers and
native Indian ‘sepoys’ (junior ranks). In 1813 the British government ended the Company’s monopoly over
trade with India and the EIC became solely an administrative body, ruling Indian territory.
The British introduced a land taxation system known as the Permanent Settlement which adopted western
notions of land ownership and, after 1800, British rule steadily expanded. There was a power vacuum after
the decay of the Mughal Empire and, when met with resistance, the British used force to impose their
interests, often deposing hostile rulers. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled much of the Indian
sub-continent.
This period of rapid expansion was accompanied by a new policy of actively trying to ‘reform’ or
‘westernise’ India. This was most associated with Governor General Lord William Bentinck (1828-1835)
who made English the official language for law, education and administration, and took action against
‘barbaric’ practices such as sati and the Thugee cult. Missionaries were also encouraged to enter India to
spread Christianity amongst the native population.

Where the flames of rebellion did take hold, it was in a sense a reactionary movement intending to
restore old rulers and old institutions – the symbols, perhaps, of a reborn Hindustan nation; but its
positive, constructive side was never very strong. What united its participants was not any very clear
vision of the future, but a hatred of the British. That hatred was fanned by the recent policies of the
East India Company, and also by the manner in which they had been implemented. To the rebels
British policy appeared as a deliberate attempt to seize their lands, humiliate their rulers, impoverish
their people, subvert their customary ways of life and destroy their religions, often in the teeth of
solemn promises not to do so, by a group of infidels with dubious motives and unpleasant manners.
That this was how they saw the intentions of the British denoted, to say the least, a failure of
communication between rulers and ruled; but even the best of imperial public relations officers would
have found it difficult to disabuse Indians of these ideas, for many of them were true, and indeed were
never contradicted by the British.

First Indian War of Independence?

Even though the Awadh mutineers once referred to themselves as ‘the Army of India’, there is nothing
in what they said or did to suggest that they could have comprehended, let alone wanted, an
equivalent to the Indian state that emerged during the twentieth century. Individually and collectively,
Indians were not bent on the creation of a unified nation state. Instead what came out of the mutiny
was a fragmentation which would have gathered momentum if more men like Devi Singh had been
free to emerge. The old ways returned in the district around Mathura almost the moment that British
authority dissolved. In some places, domestic slavery and suti made a comeback. Where national
consciousness was evident among the rebels, it was defined as a loathing for the Britis h which, at
times, seemed so intense that it appeared that they were waging a racial war of extermination. There
was wholesale destruction of all things British including railway engines which were shattered by
cannon fire at the orders of the rioters at Allahabad. Intelligent Indians shared the British horror at
this manic Luddism. The barrier and prejudices created by religion, caste, clan and tribes were still too
strong to allow the cultivation of national sentiment or cohesion even if the rebels attemp ted to do
so. The princes were unwilling to commit themselves to a rebellion. Once the war began to swing in
Britain’s favour, it was prudent to show active support.
From: Lawrence James, Raj. The Making and Unmaking of British India, 1997.

The events of 1857 have often been taken to mark a watershed in both British rule and the Indian
response to it. But the interpretation of these events remains controversial, and so does their title.
Known to the British as ‘the Sepoy’, ‘Bengal’ or ‘Indian Mutiny’, to Indians as the National Uprising or
the First War of Independence, and to the less partisan as the Great Rebellion, what happened in 1857
defies simplistic analysis. Equating the rebellion with the traditional, even ‘feudal’ form of reaction,
whose failure would usher in the new age of nationalism, and politically organised protest is no longer
acceptable. Many different groups with different grievances became aligned with either side in the
Great Rebellion. The rights and wrongs of British rule were not always a decisive factor and the frontier
between the two sides sliced through both agrarian and urban communities, both settled and nomadic
peoples, both high caste and low, both landlord and tenant, Muslim and Hindu. There was something
of a national character in both those who opposed the rebellion as well as in that of those who
supported it.

The British Raj after the Mutiny
Fears concerning ‘native’ sensitivities to social and religious changes of any sort inaugurated an era of
social and religious laissez faire which put an end to reform legislation in India for more than three
decades after 1858. There was an indifference to the plight of women, untouchables, and exploited
children. Missionaries were instructed to cut back their attempts at conversion. With the government
of India pressed to pay back the entire cost of the British military operations, spending on education
was the first to be cut. The one institution in which reforms were made was the army. The ratio of
Indian to British troops was reduced. The British were given exclusive control over artillery. Princes
and lesser gentry were wooed. Dalhousie’s egalitarian policy of treating all natives as equal was
reversed, but his policies of technological modernization were continued. The post -war era was a
period of unprecedented capital investment. Railway construction advanced rapidly. Perhaps the most
pervasive impact of the war, however, was the psychological wall of racial distrust it raised between
Britain’s white and India’s native populations. The bitter legacy of atrocities in 1857 remained to
poison the memories of Englishmen and Indians alike. The wall that insulated white sahib so ciety from
the natives loomed impervious to any but a handful of princes and landed gentry. By 1877 Britain’s
new order had taken such firm hold over the subcontinent that Disraeli was able to convince Queen
Victoria of the wisdom of adding ‘Empress of India’ to her regalia.

After 1857, the Mutiny was important as a myth and inspiration; what it was later believed to have
been was more important than what it actually was. The really disastrous and important effect of the
Mutiny was the wound it gave to British goodwill and confidence. Whatever the expressed intentions
of British policy, the attitude of the British in India was from this time influenced by the memory that
Indians had once proved almost fatally untrustworthy. The mythical importance of the Mutiny grew
with time. The atrocities that had actually been committed in 1857 were bad enough, but unspeakable
ones that had never occurred were also used as grounds for a policy of repression and social
exclusiveness.

Adapted from David Cannadine, Ornamentalism (Penguin; 2001), chapter
four
After the Mutiny of 1857, the Bentinck-Macaulay-Dalhousie policy (and stereotype)
of overturning the corrupt, despotic, ruling regimes that they had believed India to
be was largely given up. This was replaced by the alternative policy (and the
alternative stereotype) that regarded the established order much more favourably,
and as something that ought to be promoted and preserved. ‘Traditional’, ‘time less’
and ‘unchanging’ South Asia now became an object to cherish rather than to
criticise: once the target of reformers, India had now become the hope of
reactionaries. But India was a large and complex country, an entire subcontinent
populated by teaming millions embracing two powerful and competing religions.
There were territories administered by the British, which were ruled from Calcutta
(and later from New Delhi), and there were between five and six hundred autonomous princely states, which
constituted roughly one third of the subcontinent. How, in the decades after the mutiny, did the British re envisage and re-establish this most resonant and romantic part of their empire, ‘ordering into a single hierarchy
all its subjects, Indian and British alike’?
One way in which they did so was by giving more attention to the concepts and categories of caste. During the
closing decades of the rule of the East India Company, the theory of caste had become more rigidified, and its
influence spread into areas ranging from the ritual practices of South Indian temples to the honours system of
Indian princes. As such, and further instrumentalised by the courts, caste penetrated deep into South Asian
society, restructuring the relations of public worship, physical mobility, marriage and inheritance. The result was
an immobile, status-bound vision of the Indian social order, which in the second half of the 19th century became
even more attractive to the British than in the years of the Company. The British came to look up on caste as ‘the
essential feature of the Indian social system’, as the analogue to their own carefully ranked domestic status
hierarchy, which seemed to make Indian society familiar. By 1901 caste was used in the Indian census as the
equivalent to the social categories used in Britain. Thus regarded, India seemed to the British to be an integrated
and coherent hierarchy, with an accepted order of social precedence that they could grasp and understand…
The particular, localised form that this society took was the village community… Agricultural communities were
seen as the essence of the existing social and economic order.
It was atop this layered, agrarian image of Indian society that the British constructed a system of government
that was simultaneously direct and indirect, authoritarian and collaborationist, but that always took for granted
the reinforcement and preservation of tradition and hierarchy. The imperial presence, in the two thirds of the
country directly ruled, took the form of a fixed official order… When it came to the implementation of justice
and the collection of revenue, the Raj needed dependable allies. Just as British local government had always
depended on the resident aristocracy and gentry [in Britain], so their chosen partners in Sou th Asia were the
‘natural leaders’: large landowners, men of ‘property and rank’, of ‘power and importance’, who ‘exercised great
influence’ in rural society. As the British saw them, Indian landlords were to fulfil the assigned role of English
notables, because they possessed traditional status and authority in the localities that made their participation
in the imperial enterprise both valuable and reliable. The Talukdars in the United Provinces, with their landed
estates, or the Pirs of Sind, wielding religious, social and economic influence, were significant examples.
The remaining third of India consisted of the princely states, those 500 -odd personal fiefdoms ruled over by
rajahs and maharajahs, nawabs and nizams, which after 1857 were no longer revile d as alien and corrupt, but
acclaimed as familiar and traditional. ‘The policy of suppressing, or suffering to go to ruin, all the aristocracy and
gentry of India, is a mistake’, opined Sir Charles Wood, the Secretary of State for India in the aftermath of the
Mutiny. During his period of office, it was put promptly into reverse, as criticism was replaced by celebration,
disruption by preservation. The princes were to be attached directly to the British crown; there were to be no

~ 57 ~

further annexations; and they were reassured that on the failure of natural heirs, the adoption of a successor
would be recognised. Put more positively, this meant the British resolved to rule one third of India indirectly
through the princes, and through the deeply-rooted hierarchical social structure of which they were both the
expression and the apogee. As nominally autonomous native states, they administered themselves under British
paramountcy, with residents from the Indian Political Service assigned to them as advisers. They were carefully
ranked and ordered, they were obsessed with protocol and the number of guns they received in salute… They
seemed, then, just like the British aristocracy and gentry.
The view of the basic structures of Indian society, as caste -ridden, village-living and princely-led, became the
conventional British wisdom in the decades immediately after the Mutiny, and as the last quarter of the 19th
century opened, it was more deliberately encouraged and energetically projected. Here, Benjamin Disraeli was
a crucial figure. For it was he who, as Prime Minister, passed the Imperial Titles Act in 1876, which declared
Queen Victoria to be Empress of India. This audacious appropriation consolidated and completed the British Indian hierarchy, as the queen herself replaced the now defunct Mughal emperor at the summit of the social
order. As a result, the position of her representative [the viceroy] was ceremonially inflated and extravagantly
enhanced. The first climax of this knew culture of ornamentation was the pr oclamation of the queen as Empress
of India by the viceroy, Lord Lytton, at the great durbar of 1877. From one perspective, this represented the
successful appropriation of the indigenous, South Asian symbolic form of the durbar, or ceremonial meeting
between rulers and ruled, which articulated the traditional social order and legitimated the position of the
queen-empress at the head of it. But it was also an improvised, pseudo-mediaeval spectacular of rank and
inequality which indicated that the British were increasingly projecting an image of their South Asian empire as
a ‘feudal order’. Appropriately enough, special emphasis was placed upon the role of the ruling princes, who
were hailed and presented as the native aristocracy of the country.
This image of India protected and projected by the Raj - glittering and ceremonial, layered and traditional,
princely and rural, reached what has rightly been called its ‘elaborative zenith’ at the coronation durbar of 1911
when, at his own insistence, the King-Emperor George V appeared in person with a newly made imperial crown,
thereby surpassing even Curzon's extravaganza of 1903… The king and queen journeyed to Delhi, where a canvas
city had been constructed, accommodating people in strict order of social precedenc e, along with pavilions, a
reviewing ground and an amphitheatre; and there they resided, among princes, governors, heralds, troops and
escorts, and 200,000 visitors. They made their formal state entry in a five -mile long procession, and they later
appeared in full coronation finery to receive the homage of the princes. ‘It was’, the king recalled with rare
effusiveness, ‘the most beautiful and wonderful sight I ever saw’.
For the British in India, and for their friends, allies and collaborators, hierarchy was indeed ‘the axis around which
everything turned’. The same could, of course, be said of Britain, and this was scarcely coincidence. Perhaps that
was why India exercised such an appeal for so long to the romantic, Disraelian side of the British imaginati on. As
the late 19th century drew on into the early 20th, and again in the unstable inter -war years, India's was a
hierarchy that became the more alluring because it seemed to represent an ordering of society that perpetuated
overseas something important that was increasingly under threat in Britain. The interests of those within
metropolitan society who were dissatisfied with their own industrial-urban-democratic order were better served
by what they regarded as the splendid, traditional hierarchies that still flourished east of Suez.

➢ What are Cannadine’s main arguments about the British Raj after the Mutiny?

In some ways the Raj was a bluff. By the end of Queen Victoria’s reign, some 300 million Indians were
ruled by barely 1500 administrators of the Indian Civil Service. There were perhaps 3000 British
officers in the Indian Army. Leaving aside the British regiments serving in India, the total number of
Britons in the sub-continent at the end of Victoria’s reign was something like 20,000. If the Indian
people had chosen to throw off their overlords in a fashion more consistent and concerted than that
of 1857, there would have been little to prevent them. The regiments of infantry tramping down the
Grand Trunk Road, the double firsts from Oxford and Cambridge who served in the Indian Civil Service,
the social exclusiveness of the British clubs, the justice apparently handed out so even-handedly,
would have been of no avail. The divisions within Indian society, however, meant that such concerted
action was very unlikely to occur. The British continued to maintain their authority, and the power
and strength of the Raj, through the exploitation of the differences and divisions within the sub continent.

Historiography: the impact of British Rule in India
Since 1857 the British in India had been on the horns of an East/West dilemma. In order to maintain
stability they felt obliged to rule an oriental despotism by the sword and support the old order. On the
other hand, enlightened Victorians could hardly deny that good government was the raison d’être of
the Raj. ‘Sanitation, Education, Hospitals, Roads, Bridges, Navigation’, intoned Lord Mayo who became
viceroy in 1869, ‘We are trying to do in half a century what in other countries has absorbed the life of
the nation.’ Moreover, conservative as well as liberal Viceroys helped to foster the growth of Indian
nationalism. This was partly because the British, despite their proclaimed genius for government,
ruled India badly. On the one hand, Mayo took advice from Florence Nightingale about hospitals; he
promoted public works such as ports, railways and canals and irrigation schemes, and encouraged his
lonely officers to establish a ‘pure, powerful and just regime’. Every year he travelled thousands of
miles, wearing out his breeches. Yet, on the other hand, he involuntarily presided over a
subcontinental muddle. Even during the famines that ravaged India, humanity was sacrificed to
economy. British civil servants, often pig-sticking, gin-swilling public school men were impossibly
remote from their subjects.
From: Piers Brendon, The Decline and Fall of the British Empire 1781-1997, published in 2007.

What does Brendon argue about British rule after 1857?

Eventually, of course, railways changed social conditions, allowing large numbers of workers to
congregate in centres of production as never before, speeding up the flow of commodities and
creating and creating new settlements. They intensified the flow of primary produce from India’s
hinterland to the great port cities. They also allowed Indian enterprise to disperse out from these
increasingly European-dominated cities into small towns and settlements on railway lines. But these
changes were slow, and did not work out in the way British officers imagined. Neither railways nor
irrigation systems had much of an impact on the livelihood of most Indian workers for some time.
Most importantly, they did not prevent famine. Canal-building didn’t prevent some of the world’s
worst famines occurring in India during the 1870s and 1890s. Without the kind of political leadership
able to coordinate the productive activity of Indians for the benefit of society as a whole, the dreams
of ‘improvement’ projected by the prophets of modernity in the 1840s and 1850s ended up as illusory
fantasies.

What does Wilson argue about the British impact on India in the later 19th Century?

~ 63 ~

Far from crediting Britain for India’s unity and enduring parliamentary democracy, the facts point
clearly to policies that undermined it – the dismantling of existing political institutions, the fomenting
of communal division and systematic political discrimination with a view to maintaining British
domination.
In the years after 1757, the British astutely fomented cleavages among the Indian princes, and steadily
consolidated their dominion through a policy of divide and rule. Later, in 1857, the sight of Hindu and
Muslim soldiers rebelling together, willing to pledge joint allegiance to the enfeebled Mughal
monarch, alarmed the British, who concluded that pitting the two groups against one another was the
most effective way to ensure the unchallenged continuance of empire. As early as 1859, the then
British governor of Bombay, Lord Elphinstone, advised London that “Divide et impera was the old
Roman maxim, and it should be ours”.
Since the British came from a hierarchical society with an entrenched class system, they instinctively
looked for a similar one in India… Thus colonial administrators regularly wrote reports and conducted
censuses that classified Indians in ever-more bewilderingly narrow terms, based on their language,
religion, sect, caste, sub-caste, ethnicity and skin colour. Not only were ideas of community reified,
but also entire new communities were created by people who had not consciously thought of
themselves as particularly different from others around them.
Large-scale conflicts between Hindus and Muslims (religiously defined), only began under colonial
rule; many other kinds of social strife were labelled as religious due to the colonists’ orientalist
assumption that religion was the fundamental division in Indian society… The creation and
perpetuation of Hindu–Muslim antagonism was the most significant accomplishment of British
imperial policy: the project of divide et impera would reach its culmination in the collapse of British
authority in 1947. Partition left behind a million dead, 13 million displaced, billions of rupees of
property destroyed, and the flames of communal hatred blazing hotly across the ravaged land. No
greater indictment of the failures of British rule in India can be found than the tragic manner of its
ending.

Given the size of India (20% of the world population in 1820) and its centrality to the empire, it is a
devastating accusation to say that it was deliberately or even accidentally impoverished by British
policy. What is the verdict? Asian living standards had begun to fall relative to Europe long before
imperialism, partly due to political instability; and British rule did not see a further fall, but a slow rise.
Asia’s export successes had depended on cheap skilled labour: and the low cost of Indian labour made
early technology unviable. Rapid early-nineteenth-century improvements in technology meant that
English cotton goods suddenly became both cheaper and better than those of India, which
consequently lost its global markets. In the space of a generation (roughly from the 1830s to the
1850s) India this became ‘de-industrialised, as did China. However, modern mechanised cotton mills
began to be built in the 1850s, and by 1876 India reached the ‘one million spindle’ mark – twenty
years before Japan and thirty before Brazil. Famous names appeared at this time: JN Tata visited
Lancashire in 1872 and six years later opened modern cotton mills at Nagapur; his son, Sir Dorabji
Tata, established a huge steelworks in 1911. By 1900 India had the fourth-largest cotton industry in
the world, after England, the USA and Russia. It also had the fourth-largest railway system in the world
(paid for by Indians but with British technical direction and aided by cheap British capital), with three
quarters of Asia’s total track – thirty-five times more than China. Agricultural export growth in India
was comparable to Brazil’s. Indian industry began competing successfully with British imports –
especially as the imperial government gave preference to Indian-produced goods. The colonies,
including India, were very lightly taxed – probably less so than if they had been independent: Indian
taxes were 20-40 per cent lower than in the non-European world in general, and lower in British India
than in the semi-autonomous princely states.
But, even if all this is accepted, the worst accusation is that colonial rulers, by encouraging exportoriented commercial agriculture and building railways, destroyed traditions subsistence farming, using
free-market economics as a ‘mask’ for ‘holocaust’ and ‘colonial genocide’. The worst famines in 18769, 1889-91, and 1896-1902, caused by severe droughts connected with variations in the ‘El Nino’
current, were worldwide, but particularly deadly in India, China, Brazil, Russia and east Africa. To what
extent was Britain responsible? A popular view – propagated today in a range of American universities
and radical websites – blames it for every disaster from Brazil to China because it fostered a
globalisation that brought political, social, economic and ecological catastrophe. Imperial government
failed disastrously to prevent a terrible death toll. Yet the Famine Codes, drawn up in India in the
1880s were the world’s first modern anti-famine policy, still consulted today. They proclaimed that
‘the object of State intervention is to save life… all other considerations should be subordinated to
this’. Nor did colonial authorities refuse funds – the spending of famine relief in India in 1873-4 and
1896-7 was equivalent to over £700 million in today’s values, and tens of millions of people were
assisted. But the authorities did fear that mass relief would encourage dependency and prove
financially unsustainable, and so they cut relief too quickly. They also over-estimated the ability and
willingness of the market to mobilise resources in these unprecedented crises, and were too
hierarchical, complacent, dogmatic and financially parsimonious. Was this ‘genocide’? Imperial
government did not do enough in the face of mass hunger, and this is widely accepted as an intrinsic
failing of unrepresentative governments, colonial or other. Did British policy of encouraging
commercial agriculture aggravate natural disaster? The answer is not simple. It depends on whether
one assumes that traditional agriculture could have averted similar famines at a time of exceptional
climate disturbance.

The British preferred to emphasize their investment in infrastructure, especially railways and irrigation
works (‘trains and drains’). They pointed to the country’s generally favourable balance of payments.
Critics, though, were less impressed by India’s theoretical prosperity and more exercised by Indians’
actual poverty. As early as 1866 Dadabhai Naoroji, a future Congress leader, had begun to wonder
whom the trains benefited and where the drains led. His ‘drain theory’ maintained that India’s
surpluses, instead of being invested so as to create the modernized and industrialised economy
needed to support a growing population, was being drained away by the ruling power. The main d rain
emptied in London with a flood of what the government called ‘home charges’. These included salaries
and pensions for government and army officers, military purchases, India office expenses, debt
repayments and returns to investors in Indian railways. These came to nearly a quarter of India’s
annual revenue. It was not surprising that Indians lived in such abject poverty or that famines were so
frequent. Lord Lytton’s 1877 Imperial Assemblage at Delhi was the sort of wasteful extravaganza to
which Indians of almost every perspective took exception. It coincided with the worst famine of the
century which claimed perhaps 5.5 million lives in the Deccan and the south.
From: John Keay, India: A History, published in 2000.
The British rule saw a uniformity being established in India. Laws were framed that applied to all and
taxes like Jizzia (the land tax) were abolished. For the first time the Hindus regained their religious
freedom. The British and foreign scholars also started a study of the Indian scriptures and the result
was a concerted effort to save Indian heritage, such as the temples at Khujaraho which were in decay
were restored. The British also set up colleges and universities and a fair and efficient judicial system
that traces its origin to British rule. In addition they set up the framework of administration by setting
up the Indian civil service and the police service. These are now the backbone of Indian democracy.
The British created an excellent road and rail network that crisscrossed the entire country and for the
first time a resident from Lahore could travel to Calcutta or the Deep South without hindrance. Not
content with these achievements, the British also abolished the evil practices like Sati and thuggism
which were the bane of Indian society. For this alone the British rulers deserve our admiration. The
British also created the postal services and the armed services. The British rule brought in knowledge
and enlightenment and for the first time the concept of India as a nation took shape. The monuments
to British rule are legion. Suffice it to say that India progressed more in 200 years of English rule than
in 600 years earlier. The concept of equality and fair play is something we learnt from the English as
well as the concept that an officer of the Indian army was also a gentleman. There were no doubt
some aberrations, but when we consider everything it is not hard to appreciate that this period was
almost close to the earlier Golden Age of India. Later historians will probably give due credit to the Raj
as a period of development and enlightenment after the dark period of Mughal rule.

The first generation of Indian nationalists alleged that the consequences of British rule for India’s
socio-economic development were dire. The case against imperialism was marshalled by Dadabhai
Naroji in his Poverty and Un-British Rule in India (London, 1901) and RC Dutt in The Economic History
of India in the Victorian Age (London, 1906). They draw upon the ‘drain theory’ to explain India’s rural
backwardness, widespread poverty, and recurrent famines. They asserted that India’s wealth was
being drained off to Britain, by the high costs of a foreign army and of civil administration, and in
returns on British investments. It was argued that imperialism had warped and crushed the precolonial economy, largely as a result of British manufactures displacing Indian products. A process of
de-industrialisation was alleged. Modern scholarship has, while acknowledging the existence of ‘the
drain’, been sceptical of its significance, believing it too small to explain the persistence of poverty. It
has also found difficulty in testing the theory of de-industrialisation: while manufacturing employment
failed to rise, any fall defies accurate calculation. Some handicraf t industries survived, while the
emergence of factories for the manufacture of cotton goods was a success story. By 1914 India had
the fourth largest cotton goods industry in the world and its cotton spinning industry was three times
the size of Japan’s. India’s cotton industry was predominantly owned and managed by Indians
themselves, rather than by British agencies.
What is more certain is that under the Raj neither official nor private agencies injected sufficient funds
to stimulate the economy at large. For reasons of national security fiscal policy remained conservative,
leaving governments with only meagre capacity for expansive activity, although they might have
directed their purchasing policies more to Indian suppliers. Concern for security and social
conservatism also meant that governments were reluctant to countenance rural upheaval. In the
Deccan (1879) and the Punjab (1900) there was legislative intervention to inhibit the alienation of land
from agriculturalists; elsewhere tenancy acts protected rights of occupancy. In 1900 almost threequarters of male workers were employed in rural activities and the urban population was only about
10% of the whole.

EXAMPLE ESSAY 1: ‘British policies towards India completely changed in the years 1857 to 1877.’
Explain why you agree or disagree with this view.
The year 1857 is often taken as a key turning point in Britain’s policies towards India owing to the Indian Mutiny. Whilst va st
areas of India remained untouched, the impact the rebellion on British authority was sufficient to cause a series of complete
changes in politics, the military and public opinion in the years from 1857 to 1877, and in the development of the economy
and, more gradually, in education.
The most obvious and far reaching change in British policy to India was political, with the introduction of the Government of
India Act in 1858. This transferred all the political powers enjoyed by the East India Company directly to the British Crown
and furthermore meant that Queen Victoria later became the Empress of India. In order to bolster support from the Indian
nobility, the loyalty of the majority of India’s princes was recognised through the removal of the much hated ‘doctrine of
lapse’ and an elaborate hierarchy of status was created conferring prestige on the princes. This particul ar policy had a degree
of continuity insofar as Europeans had always had to work with the existing rulers in India, but the significance of the change
was that it formalised such arrangements with Victoria as the princes’ undisputed superior. Another key political
development during this period was the creation of a new structure to govern India. The November 1858 Proclamation
created the position of Secretary of State for India to be advised by the Council of India which consisted of fifteen members
who had experience of India. This was designed to limit the worst excesses that had occurred under the East India Company
and give the British Government the ability to direct policy in India. Meanwhile, the position of Governor-General became
known as the Viceroy, emphasising the fact that he was now the monarch’s representative in India as well as head of the
Government in India. Overall, British policies in terms of political control completely changed in this period as they
constituted a clear signal that Britain was to exercise total authority over her Indian subjects, a point reinforced with Victoria
becoming Empress of India 1877.
Alongside political changes, the period 1857-77 also included significant military reforms. The British Indian army was
immediately reformed as a result of the Mutiny. The armies of the East India Company were brought under the control of
the British Crown. Elements that had been disloyal to the British were disbanded and recruitment increased from more loyal
sections of Indian society, the Sikh, North West Muslim and Ghurkha communities. The number of British officers and troops
was increased to improve control and greater respect shown to sepoy beliefs and traditions and Indian regiments were not
permitted to have artillery in order to safeguard against future revolts. Whilst further military changes occurred after this
period with the Kitchener reforms in 1903, the transfer of military power from the East India Company to the British Crown
represented a complete change from before 1857.
Alongside political and military developments there was also a marked change in British attitudes towards Indians between
1857 and 1877. Victorian morals had been outranged by the (sometimes exaggerated) tales of torture, rape and the killing
of women and children in 1857. The brutality of British reprisals created fear, hatred and greater separation where
coexistence, or in some cases British admiration for an unfamiliar culture, had been the norm. Whilst superior attitudes
towards ‘native populations’ existed before the Mutiny, the violence served to harden these beliefs and create a greater
degree of separation between the British and the Indians, even though the majority had not rebelled. The need for stability
against this background was reflected by significant legal change during the 1860s. East India Company courts were merged
with the Crown courts and the British introduced a system based largely on English law. However, after the Mutiny there
was also a growing recognition that imposing European cultural values on the Indian population could prove counterproductive so greater care was taken over religiously sensitive areas in relation to the registering of women for census
purposes or the age at which children could marry. Mindful of such religious sensitivities British missionary activity was also
discouraged. The events of 1857 clearly had a profound impact on British policies to India, both in the political and military
sense, but also in the way the British public and the British in India, perceived Indians themselves.
In terms of the economy it could be argued that British policies in the period 1857-1877 certainly grew but did not completely
change. The East India Company had already established an overwhelmingly significant economic presence in India,
dominating European trade to the subcontinent and involving itself in the lucrative markets of jute, cotton, saltpetre and
opium. Moreover, India provided a profitable market for British goods before 1857. The Company’s monopoly on trade in
India had ended in 1833 and so an increasing number of independent British and European traders and merchants had
already started to establish themselves. Bringing India under British political control led to far greater British and Europe an
investment after 1857, with the number of tea plantations increasing from one in 1851 to 295 by 1871. Similarly, the first
railways started to be developed in the 1850s, with 15,000 miles of track laid by 1880. However, though the first European-

~ 70 ~

style factories were introduced in the 1850s, the vast majority of manufactured goods still came from Britain during this
period and there was virtually no heavy industry. By 1877 the majority of Indians remained engaged in subsistence farming,
suggesting that British policies to India had not yet caused complete economic change, with the major changes in Indian
economic development such as the growth in domestic production of cotton coming later in the decades after 1877.
A final aspect of British policy in India that developed rather than completely changed was that of education. The need for
British educational influence in India was championed by Macaulay as early as 1835. The creation of an education system to
create anglicised Indians to serve as go-betweens in assisting the British to manage their interests in the sub-continent was
therefore well established before 1857. Despite a background of some government hostility in London, a clear commitment
to a western form of instruction conducted in English was achieved. Hundreds of schools were founded and the tens of
thousands of Indians educated, a third of whom entered into public administration. Moreover the first universities in
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were established in 1857, at the start of the period in question. T his policy of providing an
English education therefore was not a complete change, as it started before 1857, but it continued to develop to meet the
needs of the Raj over the next decades.
In conclusion, whilst there had been attempts to curtail the powers of the East India Company before 1857, and education
reforms were established as early as 1835, it is fair to say that British policies towards India did change significantly, if not
completely, in the years 1857-1877. The Mutiny reshaped the way in which India was governed and how the military was
structured and organised in the subcontinent. Moreover, the shock that the brutality of the Mutiny caused shifted political
and public attitudes towards Indians and the nature of colonialism. Whilst any change took time to take effect, the formal
transfer of power to Britain, greater economic development, the position of Viceroy and Victoria’s crowning as Queen
Empress during this period are sufficient in scale to suggest that British policies in India underwent a complete change from
1857-1877.

Commentary – Level 5 This is an excellent response; detailed, accurate and with range in relation to
how policies changed and why. The only weakness is the extent which there is a consistent
assessment of ‘complete’ change, although there are references to this towards the end of the
answer and the conclusion reaches a judgement as to whether change was complete. Given the
detail, control and relevance, this is a strong Level 5 response.

EXAMPLE ESSAY 2: ‘British rule in India combined self-interest with an arrogant attitude of racial
superiority towards the native population.’ Assess the validity of this view with reference to the
years 1857 to c1900.
After the 1857 Indian Revolt, the way in which Britain ruled India was re-examined. The British government realised that the
coercion and brute force would not be enough to retain control of Britain’s ‘jewel in the crown’. Reforms were undoubtedly
needed and these were introduced under the 1858 ‘Government of India Act’. Whilst the educational and infrastructure
reforms were beneficial to India and helped to reduce the risk of further uprising, to a great extent they were introduced
merely to solidify British hegemony over India and to satisfy self-interest. British attitudes towards the native population
were characterised by an air of arrogance which was integrated into Anglo-Indian society. There were some attempts to
promote racial equality. Nevertheless, it would be hard to argue that an equilibrium was ever reached. It is clear that there
were multiple aspects to British rule in India; whilst there is evidence to suggest that reforms were introduced to improve
India, self-interest and self-proclaimed racial superiority played major roles in the running of the subcontinent.
The idea of racial superiority is evident in the way India was governed. The viceroy, and all the senior officials in government
were British. Whilst the Indian Civil Service did accept Indian applicants after 1858, they only made up 5% of the civil service
by 1900. Many British did not believe Indians to be intelligent or reliable enough to run the country and felt an India ruled
by Britain was much more efficient. One third of the country was ruled by Indian princes suggesting that certain Indians were
deemed to be acceptable rulers by the British state. However, arguably this was just a strategic decision made by Britain a
bid to run an ‘empire on the cheap’. The princes were given British advisors so as to ensure loyalty to Britain, showing that
the princes’ powers were severely limited; whilst the princes were respected, they would be forced to conform to what
Britain believed was a superior foreign government. A belief in the racial inferiority of the Indian population was endemic to
British rule. Ultimately, the British posted in India did not trust the indigenous people to be in charge of their own country.
Another example of this self-proclaimed superiority can be seen in the way the British officials separated themselves from
Indian society. Many high ranking British civil servants migrated to high altitude hill stations to find refuge from both the
summer heat and what they thought to be an ‘unclean’ native population. The British made attempts not to associate
themselves with Indian culture or ‘go native’. Instead they introduced British culture into these areas, building cricket pitches,
churches and clubs. At Darjeeling, a tunnel was dug underneath the botanical gardens so the British would not have to lay
their eyes on the natives in this area. The British inhabitants refused to allow ‘unclean’ Indians to buy houses in these hill
stations, leading to a high concentration of British nationals living in these areas. Towns such as Shimla could have been
mistaken for English market towns. The annual hill station migration was incontrovertibly driven by a sense of racial
superiority and a desire for an isolated British community; the inhabitants felt that the natives were merely savages who
would dirty a pure and clean British culture.
Self-interest too played a significant role in British occupation of India. By 1900, Britain was the third largest industrial power
and used India as a marketplace for its goods. Cotton goods were sold in India, undercutting local equivalents. In addition,
railway tracks were made in England and exported to India which greatly benefited British manufacturing companies.
Indentured labourers from India were also exploited by Britain, working as unofficial slaves in Africa until they were freed
after five years of service. There was an economic imbalance between Britain and India (known as the ‘Drain Theory’) in
which Indian resources and markets were exploited by Britain. Companies from Britain saw India as a ‘cash-cow’ (25% of all
British investment was targeted at India), and were able to make huge profits from the sub-continent. Furthermore, an
arrogant attitude of racial superiority led to low wages being paid to Indian workers, which of course meant improved profits
for British companies.
British rule in India could also be seen as a way for the British government to save money. The Indian Army was made up of
around 140,000 soldiers and could be sent to British war zones for a lower cost due to reduced journey times (such as in
south Africa during the Boer Wars). The army was seen as expendable because it was made up of mostly sepoys and therefore
made it an extremely effective tool for Britain; Lord Salisbury (Prime Minister from 1895-1902) stated that India was simply
an ‘army barrack’. Ultimately, Britain used India for its own economic benefit and economic interests undoubtedly played a
role in the way the country was governed.
Whilst there is strong evidence to suggest that self-interest and arrogance did play that parts in British rule, there is evidence
of benevolent government in India. Although the Indian civil service appointed very few Indians, British members were
educated in Indian cultures and languages and, after the Mutiny, they were particularly sensitive of native attitudes and

~ 72 ~

traditions. Civil servants were often overworked and underpaid . Gopal Krishna Gokhale (an Indian moderate) stated that
many civil servants possessed ‘a high level of ability’, ‘a keen sense of duty’ and a ‘conscientious desire’ to do good to those
with restricted opportunities; many involved in Indian government was not driven by self-interest but rather, a genuine
desire to improve the country. Notable efforts were made to modernise India; Britain had laid down 20,000 miles of railway
track by 1900 and the railway lines helped to reduce the effects of famine as food could be more easily distributed across
the country. Implementing and maintaining this infrastructure required labourers, leading to an increase in the number of
job opportunities for local workers. Irrigation systems were also introduced which greatly assisted Indian farmers; an area of
80,000 square miles had been irrigated by 1900. Farmers and peasants were the main beneficiaries of these infrastructure
improvements which highlighted a selfless aspect of British rule. There is clearly evidence, therefore, that the British
government was keen to improve India and the lives of its population.
The introduction of an education system in India further supports the idea that the British were not entirely self-interested.
By 1901 there were 191 arts/professional colleges in India and 5,124 secondary schools. Although some Indians opposed the
English education system, feeling that it was an attempt to nurture a conformist attitude in young Indians, it did help to
educate over half a million Indians by the turn of the century. Sixty-thousand potential doctors, lawyers, teachers and other
skilled workers had been trained by 1900. By educating these individuals, Britain was able to provide India with a foundation
of middle-class natives who would be instrumental in the future development of the country. The education system also
promoted the English language, which would improve relations between Indian communities and help to unify India. A
common language would also strengthen Anglo-Indian relations, ultimately leading to more effective governance. Again, this
is evidence to show the British involvement in India did benefit the country, suggesting that the British Raj was not solely
driven by selfish motives.
Altogether, British rule in India was certainly fuelled to some extent by self-interest and arrogance. Very few Indians were
given positions of power due to the widespread British belief that the native population were not competent to ‘self-rule’.
Partly because the natives were treated with such low regard, Britain saw India as exploitable and used its resources for
economic benefit. Low wages and an army based in India also helped the British government to save money. However, the
British Raj was driven by benevolence as well as self-interest. Farmers, peasants and middle-class workers all benefited from
Britain’s efforts to modernise India. New infrastructure helped to provide work for many locals and also improved the quality
of life for many individuals. The efforts of the Indian Civil Service and the creation of educational institutions left an important
legacy which would help create the conditions for independence in the 20 th century. Ultimately, British rule was complex
and individuals would often have a range of conflicting attitudes; there is no doubt that British interests and a belief of racial
superiority played major roles in the government of India. However, this was often tempered with benign intentions.

Commentary – Level 5: This is a well-controlled, balanced and relevant assessment with very
impressive detail which rarely turns into narrative description. The terms of the question are both
corroborated and challenged and this is a Level 5 response.

The emergence of nationalism in India
Read:
•

p. 112 in AQA text

After the Mutiny the British had tied themselves to the traditional indigenous elites (the princely
states) and tried to impose a Victorian neo-feudal concept of society on India (Tory-entalism –
Ferguson). Lytton and later Curzon can be seen as the Viceroys most supportive of this concept.
Simultaneously the British disparaged the educated Indian middle classes – the Bengali babus – as
being unrepresentative of India. The Anglicised Indian classes that had been created before the Mutiny
were now openly mocked and not regarded as an authentic voice of India.
➢ What is ‘nationalism’? How is it defined? What problems did it face in India?

Key Concept: ‘Imagined Communities’ (Benedict Anderson, 1983)
Changing Contexts: In the later 19th Century there had been something of an educational revolution,
especially in Bengal (amongst the bhadralok – Bengali middle classes). 1855: 47 English language
schools in Bengal; 1902: 1,481. There had also been a growth in university education, especially in
Calcutta which contained the world’s largest university (8,000 students) by 1900.
Furthermore, there had been an enormous growth in the Indian press: by 1885 there were 319
vernacular titles and 96 English language ones. The spread of the railway and the telegraph also meant
that news travelled fast. The nationalist Bangabasi in Calcutta circulated 20,000 copies a week.

Growing Frustration:
Despite these educational advances, there were few prospects for advancement for the educated
Indians. In particular the ICS: in 1909 only 65/1,244 were Indian.
Indian Association formed 1876 – pressured for greater opportunities for Indians within the ICS
Ilbert Bill (1883): Lord Ripon was appointed by Gladstone as a Liberal viceroy to replace Lord Lytton.
(Sir Courtenay Ilbert was the legal member of the Viceroy’s Council). The Ilbert Bill would have enabled
native Indian magistrates to pass judgment over Europeans.

~ 75 ~

This caused outrage amongst the European community (especially non-official Anglo-Indians –
planters, railway managers etc.). Anglo-Indian and European Defence Association lobbied successfully
to drop the most contentious parts of the Bill (a European could now opt for a European judge).
Indian National Congress formed 1885 in the wake of the furore of the Ilbert Bill (1883) – a belief that
organisation (in the style of British campaigning groups) might form a powerful pressure group:
•
•

The problems of creating ‘nationalism’ in India – little national awareness amongst the
peasantry – chiefly a middle class phenomenon.
Focus on campaigning in Britain and Calcutta – much sympathy in London from Liberals and
Irish Home Rulers → Dadabhai Naoroji elected as MP for Finsbury in 1892

The difficulties of nationalism, 1885-1914
Divisions: Pre-1914 leadership of ‘moderate’ Gopal Krishna Gokhale (influenced by British Liberalism)
and ‘extremist’ Bal Gangadhar Tilak (emphasis on Hindu heritage (Maratha inspired) and viole nt
resistance) → conflict and tension between an emphasis on ‘progress’ and social improvement vs. a
respect for tradition and religion. Hostility to the latter would alienate the vast majority of the Indian
population (as the British had found in 1857).
Curzon hostile to nationalism and liberalism – determined to reassert autocratic and traditional rule
in India. Deeply hostile to the INC. Partition of Bengal an attempt to neuter the political criticism within
Bengal. Responses to Curzon’s viceroyalty:
•

Impact of the partition of Bengal (1905) – swadeshi (self-sufficiency – boycott of British goods)
campaign – (the first successful nationalist resistance to the Raj?)

The anticipation of future divisions: Formation of the All India Muslim League (1906)
Violence:
Emergence and growth of nationalist newspapers (Kesari & Kaal) – Kesari published by Tilak → 1896
attempts to stop the spread of plague in Bombay led to hostility from the press as rumours spread →
two British officials killed
Abhinav Bharat (Young India) – founded 1903 – a secret society dedicated to armed revolution and
violence against British rule.
1907 – unrest in the ‘canal colonies’ (newly irrigated regions) over high charges and new regulations
– unrest spread to peasantry and the army → reforms dropped by Viceroy Minto
Assassinations:
-

1908 – two British women killed by a bomb meant for a British District Judge
Sir William Curzon Wyllie – ADC at India Office (July 1909) – in London
1912 – attempted assassination of Viceroy Lord Hardinge in Delhi

Case Study: Sir Surendranath Banerjea (18481925) Adapted from the ODNB entry by Tapan Raychaudhuri
Surendranath Banerjea was born in Calcutta in November
1848. His father was one of the leading doctors in the city
and had received an English education. Educated at
Doveton College, Calcutta, Banerjea left for England to sit
the ICS exams in 1869. He was successful and was
admitted to the service, being appointed assistant
magistrate in Sylhet in 1871. He was dismissed for
‘negligence’ in 1873, however, having signed a document
marking an adjourned case as ‘closed’. This heavy-handed
response to a minor clerical error was widely perceived to
be a consequence of racism, especially as Banerjea and his
wife had tried to claim equality of social status with white magistrates.
Banerjea travelled to Britain and unsuccessfully tried to appeal his dismissal. He then tried to become a barrister
in England but, because of the dismissal, his call to the bar was refused. He returned to Calcutta in disgrace and
became a teacher which remained his profession for the following 37 years. He established a new college in
1882, later renamed Ripon College.
In speeches to the Calcutta Students' Association, Banerjea quickly gained a reputation as an inspirational
speaker. He was inspired by nationalist movements in Europe and sought to inspire a ‘genuine, sober and
rational interest in public affairs' amongst the young men he encountered. A moderate who favoured
constitutional methods, he rejected violent action. The Indian Association, established in 1876, became a forum
for middle-class Indians who sought greater representation and involvement in the political system of their
country. Banerjea’s speaking tours would attract audiences of around 30,000 people and he focused on issues
such as ending discrimination in the criminal justice system, freedom of the press, and the abolition of the hated
salt tax.
He recognized that there was a growing class of educated Indians who were frustrated by the limited
opportunities and he campaigned for greater Indian access and admission to the ICS. He started editing a
newspaper, The Bengalee, in 1879 to propagate his ideas. This became a daily paper in 190 0. An article criticizing
a Calcutta judge in 1883 led to Banerjea’s imprisonment which caused widespread resentment amongst his
supporters. Indeed, at times Banerjea was spoken of as the uncrowned king of Bengal.
The disagreements over the Ilbert Bill sharpened the sense of grievance amongst many Indians and the Indian
National Congress was founded in 1885. Banerjea was a key member from its inception and was twice elected
its president (in 1895 and 1902). He was a member of the Bengal legislative council for eight years from 1893,
and visited Britain as a member of a Congress mission to plead for increased Indian representation in decision making bodies.
Banerjea adopted confrontational tactics in campaigning against Curzon’s partition of Bengal in 1905 – he was
arrested and fined for leading a banned procession. Yet, fundamentally Banerjea was a moderate and eschewed
the more violent resistance favoured by some members of Congress.
After the First World War, Banerjea cooperated with British reforms and was knighted in 1919. He joined the
Bengal cabinet as minister for local government in 1921 and, amongst younger nationalists, his credibility began
to weaken. In 1923, he was defeated in the local elections and, for a man once regarded as the father of national
consciousness, this was an intolerable humiliation. He died, a broken man, in Calcutta on 6 August 1925.

The Raj lacked the means for mass coercion →
concessions were the only alternative:
attempts to split the moderates from the
extremists. In particular there was a fear of
censure from liberal voices in London if
coercion was excessive.
Viceroy Minto (1905-10) replaced Curzon. He
was supported by the new Liberal government
in Britain that was elected with a landslide in
1906. The Liberal Party were determined to
take a different approach to the empire than
the preceding Conservative government and
the new Secretary of State for India, John
Morley, worked with Minto on introducing a
limited set of reforms to India. Moderation and
conciliation were intended to be the dominant
themes:

•

Greater consultation with Congress – a
desire to engage with the ‘moderates’ for fear that the ‘extremists’ might otherwise gain
support. NOT democratic reforms however.
Dismissal of Sir Bampfylde Fuller, Lt Governor of East Bengal in 1906 for using overly coercive
measures against unrest associated with the swadeshi movement
Indian Councils Act (1909) – elected Indians to Viceroy’s Council

❖ To what extent was the British Raj secure by 1914?

~ 79 ~

The British had set out to create Indians in their own image. However, when they alienated the Indian
Anglicised elite, they produced a Frankenstein’s monster. In the late nineteenth century the British
had called into being an English-speaking, English-educated elite of Indians; a class of civil service
auxiliaries on whom their system of administration had come to depend. In time, these people
naturally aspired to have some share in the government of the country, just as some V ictorians had
predicted. But, in the age of Curzon, they were spurned in favour of decorative but largely defunct
Maharajas. The result was that by the Empress-Queen Victoria’s twilight years. Around the turn of the
century, British rule in India was like one of those palaces Curzon adored. It looked simply splendid on
the outside. But downstairs the servants were busy turning the floorboards into firewood.

Niall Ferguson, Empire

❖ What is Ferguson’s view of British rule by 1900?

Before 1914, despite periodic outbreaks of unrest and a bomb-throwing campaign in Bengal, there
was little sign that the British regime was in real danger. The idea that British rule would be swept
away in little more than thirty years would have seemed absurd to any rational observer, British or
Indian. That rule had its foundation, as the British admitted themselves, in its monopoly of armed
force. The large British garrison, and an Indian army recruited deliberately from minority elements in
the Indian population, were strong enough to destroy any armed insurrection (and India was now a
disarmed society) with comparative ease. The memory of the brutal ‘second conquest’ of India in
1857-8, and the ‘white terror’ that followed, died hard: to almost all Indians, the forcible overthrow
of the British was the idlest of fantasies.

Strategic Vulnerability: The Great Game
Read:
➢ pp. 76-81 in Porter
Context: Russia had expanded into central Asia and, by 1885, controlled most of the territory north of
Afghanistan. This was seen by British statesmen as a significant threat to British India. The ‘Great
Game’, as it was known, was the struggle to keep the north-west frontier safe from any potential
Russian threat. In 1839-42 the First Anglo-Afghan War saw the British invade Afghanistan to forestall
Russian influence. This ended in catastrophe and the entire destruction of a British Army. However,
by the later-19th Century the British were looking to Afghanistan with renewed interest:

Entente – the British remained
prepared for a confrontation with
Russia, although this never actually
appeared. By the early 20th Century,
both countries recognised a looming
common threat in the form of
Germany. There were agreements
over spheres of influence in Persia
(1907) and the two would be bound in
alliance during the First World War.

Continued expansion in Asia
Read:
➢ pp. 131-138 in Porter
➢ pp. 235-250 in James
Beyond India, the main aim of the British in the rest of Asia was to ensure British commercial access
to potentially lucrative markets. The British, using the might of the Royal Navy, would resort to force
to achieve this if necessary. This became known as the ‘open door policy’.

China
The Manchu dynasty ruling China pursued a policy of isolationism and limited trade with the rest of
the world. The British, on the other hand, were determined to open up China to trade and the ‘open
door policy’ was relatively successful; the opium wars opened up China to British trade and, by 1880,
Britain was responsible for 76% of all Chinese overseas trade. China was never very significant to
British trade (between 1815 and 1914 it never made up more than 1% of British ov erseas trade).
Nevertheless, because of China’s vast size and population, the potential was considered to be
enormous.
The ‘Scramble for China’
The realisation that China was a weak, declining power meant that, in the 1880s, the European powers
started to look upon Asia as a potential space in which to expand their empires. For the British, the
old policy of ‘informal empire’ seemed to be failing:

1894-5 Sino-Japanese War launched a ‘scramble for China: Russia, Japan, Germany and Britain
started to claim parts of China itself → an agreement to partition China into different trading
concessions where each power would be dominant. Yet, China survived as a nominally
independent state.

valley.

Burma:
Although the North-West Frontier was always
considered to be the most vulnerable part of
India, there were also concerns on the NorthEastern Frontier where India bordered the
unstable kingdom of Burma. The British
fought two wars with the Burmese in 1824-26
and 1852 which led to the annexation of
Lower Burma, including the capital Rangoon,
in 1852 and the concession of trading rights to
British merchants. Upper Burma remained a
landlocked rump state where the Burmese
monarchy relocated its capital to the city of
Mandalay.
The loss of territory weakened the monarchy and there were several factors that led to a third war
between the British and Burma in 1885:
•

•
•

•

1880s – the French took control of Indo-China (present-day Vietnam) and sought to establish
preferential trade with Upper Burma. There was fear of French encroachment towards India’s
borders.
British merchants sought to secure the land trade route through Burma to southern China and
the potentially lucrative markets there.
The Burmese king from 1878, Thibaw, was fundamentally unstable; he had massacred much
of his family in his efforts to secure the throne and the British Resident had withdrawn from
Mandalay. In 1885 Thibaw attempted to restrict the rights of British merchants to trade in the
country.
Domestic British politics also played a role; the India Secretary, Lord Randolph Churchill, was
determined to demonstrate the strength and resolution of the Conservative Government
after the supposed embarrassments of Gladstone’s Liberal rule.

An ultimatum was issued in 1885 which Thibaw rejected. A British force then invaded Upper Burma
and occupied Mandalay within two weeks. 30,000 troops were then required to ‘pacify’ the country
in a brutal guerrilla campaign that lasted until 1890. Contrary to post-Mutiny policy in India, King
Thibaw was deposed, the monarchy abolished, and direct rule introduced; Upper Burma was formally
annexed as a province of British India in 1886.
Commercial exploitation followed; rice, timber and, later, oil became the most important exports. A
small minority of Indians came to dominate much of Burma’s banking and commerce. British rule came
to have an enormous cultural impact as Buddhism and monasticism declined without support from
the traditional social structure and monarchy. By 1906 the establishment of the Young Men’s Buddhist
Association signified the emergence of a cultural and national revival which would challenge British
rule.

How does the Burmese experience contrast with other examples of British imperialism in
the late 19th century?

~ 84 ~

Malaya & North Borneo:
Between 1785 and 1824 the British had taken possession of the Straits Settlements on the Malay
peninsula, the most important of which was Singapore (founded by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819).
These were small, coastal settlements that acted as trading and naval bases. Singapore in particular
became a crucial trading entrepot because of its strategic location between the Indian Ocean and the
South China Sea.
Malaya became more unstable in the 1870s after an influx of Chinese migrants (due to the increase in
tin mining) and there was significant upheaval in 1873-4. To protect the interests of the Straits
Settlements, the British government were pressured to establish formal protectorates over Malaya in
1875. This was an example of indirect rule similar to the Princely States in India, the sultans remains
in place but with British advisors who determined major policies. Over the following decades, Malaya
became a significant source of tin, as well as rubber.
By 1841 James Brooke had established himself as Rajah of Sarawak in North Borneo, from where he
led anti-piracy campaigns – another addition to Britain’s informal empire. The British Borneo
Company was granted a charter in 1881 to run north Borneo in the interests of British traders.

The Pacific:
After pressure from humanitarian and commercial lobbyists, Fiji was annexed in 1874. Australia and
New Zealand were concerned about their own security in the Pacific, especially after Germany moved
to take control of several islands in the Pacific in the 1880s and 1890s. The USA also took control of
the Philippines in 1898. South-eastern New Guinea was, therefore, formally annexed by the British as
a protectorate in 1884. However, the Pacific Islands were of little economic importance and the native
inhabitants suffered from declining populations.

❖ To what extent was British power threatened in the Far East and the Pacific?

~ 85 ~

Important as events in Africa were for the European and global balance, they were dwarfed by the
struggle for mastery in the Far East. ‘The storm centre of the world has shifted to China,’ the US
Secretary of State, John Hay, remarked, ‘whoever understands that empire… has a key to world politics
for the next five centuries.’ Here the void left by the weakness of the Chinese Empire sucked in powers
searching for resources, prestige and markets and seeking to deny them to their rivals. The Russians
pressed in from the north, outraging the Japanese by, in March 1898, leasing the Liaotung peninsula,
which Tokyo had handed back to China under international pressure three years earlier. The Germans,
French, British and others all pressed their claims on the Celestial court. Chinese nationalists saw the
‘Middle Kingdom’ under attack from all sides and rose in revolt against foreign domination. This ‘Boxer
Rising’ provoked an international intervention to suppress it, not because the powers were united in
occidental outrage against the orient, but because they feared that their competitors might seek
unilateral advantage. The widely expected complete partition of the Chinese Empire never actually
happened, because the balance of power in the region did not permit it.

Context – Africa in the mid-19 t h Century
Read:
➢ chapter 2 in Chamberlain

~ 88 ~

As late as 1963 the British historian Hugh Trevor Roper could say, ‘perhaps in the future there will be
some African history to teach. But at present there is none: there is only the history of Europeans in
Africa. The rest is darkness… and darkness is not a subject of history.’ Indeed, European images of the
‘Dark Continent’ would be pervasive well into the 20th Century.
However, these views of Africa tell us more about European
prejudice than they do about Africa. Indeed, although there were
few cultures with detailed written records, Africa had produced
great civilisations throughout its history and art (such as the 13th
century bronze heads of Ife) and structures such as the ruins of
Great Zimbabwe stood as testament to this. Although African forms
of political organisation were unfamiliar to Europeans who thought
in terms of ‘states’, there were an enormous range of complex
societies.
Africa was (and is) geographically diverse. The north coast,
separated from the rest of Africa by the Sahara desert, had long
been in contact with Europe and Asia, and Europeans were
conscious of the great and long-established civilisation of Egypt. In addition, Abyssinia (Ethiopia) was
known to be a Christian empire surrounded by Islamic territory.
By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa was much less known by Europeans, although the Arab world and
Islam had long penetrated these societies; East Africa was linked with the Arab world; Arabic slave
traders were influential inland and there were trading routes by sea between what is now Kenya and
Tanzania with Asia. However, until the middle of the 19th Century, most of the interior of the African
continent was completely unknown to Europeans. Indeed, it the climate and tropical disease made it
difficult for Europeans to survive at all.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Europeans had taken part in the trans-Atlantic slave trade – exploiting
pre-existing African slaving societies on the west coast of Africa to take Africans to colonies in the
Americas where they would be forced to work on plantations. It is estimated that, in total and prior
to the abolition of the trade in 1807, between 11-13 million Africans were forcibly transported across
the Atlantic as slaves. Europeans had little need to explore inland in
West Africa as important societies such as Benin and the Ashanti
kingdom traded directly with the Europeans. Even once slavery had
been abolished, the British felt no need to gain more territory as the
anti-slavery patrols of the West Africa squadron only needed small
bases on the coast.
By contrast, the temperate climes of Southern Africa were sparsely
populated. Dutch had settled in the area as farmers in the eighteenth
century (the Boers). As they moved inland, they came into contact
(and conflict) with Bantu societies who were steadily migrating south.
One example of these were the powerful Zulu people who formed a
successful, highly militarised state under King Shaka from 1818
onwards.

~ 89 ~

The European image of Africans
European views of Africans could be complex; a fascination with these unfamiliar societies was often
mixed with contempt for their perceived ‘backwardness’. Generally, and as a consequence of the huge
technological gap that had opened up between Europe and Africa during the Industrial Revolution,
Africans were viewed with a patronising attitude. Their climate was believed to explain their lack of
development (abundance, it was believed, had made Africans lazy and meant they had not needed to
form complex societies). Africans were viewed as ‘barbaric’ or ‘uncivilised’ as well as child-like. As
notions of ‘Social Darwinism’ developed during the 19th Century, it was believed by many that Africans
were racially inferior to Europeans.
Yet, attitudes could also be benign (if no less patronising) and many Europeans, particularly
missionaries, saw it as their duty to ‘civilise’ and develop Africans, to convert them to Christianity, and
introduce them to Western forms of commerce. The latter, in particular, was seen as an essential part
of the process to eradicate the continuing slave trade.

Religion and Empire
‘Religion and Empire frequently mingled, but were as likely to undermine each other as they were to
provide mutual support.’
– Andrew Porter, Oxford History of the British Empire Volume III
What was the religious context in Britain?
Christianity in Victorian Britain – dominant moral issues intertwining with politics
-

C of E (links with Tories)
Nonconformists (links with Liberals)
Roman Catholics (Ireland)

How was religion exported from Britain?
Religion exported in two ways:
-

With settlers
Missionaries converting native inhabitants of colonial territory

Surges in missionary activity:
-

1790s – societies established (e.g. Wesleyan Missionary Society; Church Missionary Society)
1836-44
1850s
Evangelical, nonconformist societies established first, with the Anglican Church following
Missionary activity part of an international movement

What were the aims of missionaries? What was their attitude towards indigenous people?
-

Conversion – proselytising/ spreading British culture
Generally not racist and hostile to ideas of social Darwinism BUT often quite dismissive of non European cultures and religions (impact on British attitudes towards non-European societies)
Yet, often a developing interest in indigenous languages and cultures

What was the impact of missionaries?
-

-

Mixed success in conversion
Complex interaction between missionaries and indigenous communities – not simply an
imposition of Western culture – often a liberating influence for many – also a route to personal
advancement in colonial society
Spread of ‘secular’ skills (English language, literacy, education etc.) – e.g. Mary Carpenter (180777) worked for female education in India from 1866 founded Indian training college for female
Indian teachers in 1868

~ 92 ~

What was the relationship between religion and colonial authorities?
-

Faith could precede the ‘flag’ (e.g. Eastern Africa; Fiji) or follow it (e.g. India)
Missionaries often viewed as unhelpful by authorities (e.g. in India after 1857; China after Boxer
Rebellion; Islamic northern Africa)
‘Secular’ skills promoted by missionaries often undermined colonial rule – creation of an
educated, literate nationalist group
Limited central control of churches, even C of E – new dioceses established overseas but
churches not established as in England.

Home and colonial governments supported ecclesiastical expansion wherever it was likely to buttress
their authority and promote social order. However, religious dynamics proved unpredictable and
often at odds with Imperial needs… Imperial authorities with few exceptions initially distrusted
missionary enterprise, and missions rejected all political involvement. Both sides, how ever, learned
gradually that cooperation had its uses. Missions won extensive popular support at home and,
inescapably dependent on their hosts, often acquired considerable influence with non -European
communities. They could therefore not be ignored, and might be turned to Imperial advantage.
Missionaries came to regard secular authorities in a similarly utilitarian way. British missionary
enterprise thus sometimes provided channels through which Imperial controls followed; at other
times it delayed annexation and colonisation, or even subverted Imperial authority. In many places
(sometimes on purpose, often unintentionally) Christians and their churches provided powerful
stimuli for local resistance and opposition to colonial rule.
- Andrew Porter, ‘Religion, Missionary Enthusiasm, and Empire’ in Oxford History of the British
Empire volume III

❖ What does Porter argue about the relationship between missionary activity and empire?

~ 93 ~

Explorers and Missionaries

Christianity is a proselytising religion and missionaries had long left Europe to convert non-Christian
societies to Christianity. Missionary societies had been established in Britain in the eighteenth century
(Methodists were particularly enthusiastic). By 1800 the London Missionary Society was active in
Southern Africa; in 1842 the Church Missionary Society was operating around the Niger; and in 1842
the Wesleyan Methodist Mission was attempting to spread Christianity in Ashantiland. Missionary
work was also an activity that offered women an opportunity to engage in non-European societies. In
the years after the 1857 Indian Mutiny, missionaries were no longer encouraged to be in India and so
many turned their attention to Africa where there seemed to be greater opportunities.
At the same time, a number of individuals also sought adventure and knowledge through exploration.
(Often, in fact, missionaries and explorers could work together or be one and the same person).
Mungo Park had been one of the first British explorers in Africa in two expeditions (1795-7 and 1805)
around the river Niger. Explorers and missionaries were often had a range of motives and they were
not usually encouraged by the authorities in London. Indeed, their relationship to colonial expansion
was ambiguous; they could frustrate as well as encourage commercial expansion and the annexation
of territory.
Nevertheless, they became hugely popular in Britain and helped construct the image of Africa in the
minds of the British public. Missionaries and explorers became the archetype for the Victorian imperial
hero.

Livingstone had believed in the power of the Gospel; Stanley believed only in brute force. Livingstone
had been appalled by slavery; Stanley would connive at its restoration. Above all, Livingstone had been
indifferent to political frontiers; Stanley wanted to see Africa carved up. And so it was. In the time
between Livingstone’s death in 1873 and Stanley’s death in 1904 around a third of Africa would be
annexed to the British Empire; virtually all the rest would be taken over by a handful of other European
powers. And it is only against this background of political domination that the conversion of subSaharan Africa can be understood. Commerce, Civilisation and Christianity were to be conferred on
Africa, just as Livingstone had intended. But they would arrive in conjunction with a fourth ‘C’:
Conquest.

Case Study: Nyasaland
Nyasaland (present-day Malawi) is an example of colonial
expansion being driven by the work of missionaries, of ‘the flag
following faith.’ David Livingston had explored the area during
his Zambezi expeditions of 1858 and encouraged further
missionaries to work in the area. Scottish missionaries in
particular, from the Church of Scotland, as well as the English
Universities’ Mission established a series of missions in the
area in the 1860s and 1870s, followed by businessmen looking
for commercial opportunities.
By the 1880s the Portuguese, who ruled neighbouring
Mozambique, started to assert their own sovereign rights over
Nyasaland, leading to pressure from the missionaries for the
British Government to intervene. The fact that some of the indigenous tribes were involved in slave
trading added a further moral case in favour of annexation. In 1889 the British Government declared
Nyasaland a protectorate (named the British Central African Protectorate, later renamed to Nyasaland
Protectorate in 1907).
Despite its formal designation as a protectorate, direct rule was established and (apart from the
powerful Ngoni king in the north), local tribal chiefs were left with little autonomy and the missionaries
continued their work. Although businesses took an interest and land was parcelled out to European
interests, Nyasaland remained economically insignificant; it contained no significant natural
resources, beyond a suitable climate for agriculture. Cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee were grow n and
exported in small quantities, but no railway to the coast was constructed until 1907.

British to withdraw in 1801. In 1805 a new Egyptian leader, Muhammad Ali, came to power and
asserted his independence from the Ottomans. He established a new dynasty and was succeeded by
his sons, the third of which, Isma’il Pasha, became khedive (ruler) of Egypt in 1863.

Read:
•

75-78 in AQA text

During Ismail Pasha’s reign, the foreign debt of Egypt increased from £3 million to £100 million:
-

New irrigation canals
1,000 miles of railway

Investigations revealed the essentials of the Egyptian economy to be sound – Ismail Pasha’s
modernisation was necessary. Some economic problems – drop in the cotton price after US Civil War
ended + problems with developing sugar industry. Also little capital to invest within Egypt
BUT heavy borrowing at high interest rates from European investors ➔ sale of Suez Canal shares (see
above)
1876 – Stephen Cave (British minister) sent to advise on finances + French ministers
Commission of the Public Debt established (one Frenchman and one Englishman (Evelyn Baring)) –
essentially dual Anglo-French control of state finances until 1882 – assigned revenues got the debt
under control.
BUT PROBLEMS:
-

Poor harvests in 1876-77 – some starvation and famine
Pay in arrears in the army
➔1879 – Isma’il Pasha deposed by the army; replaced by Tewfiq (his son) –
believed to be more amenable to European powers than his father

Arabi Pasha’s revolt:
Development of a nationalist movement. Hostile to European demands and to the growing European
community in Egypt (c. 100,000 – exempt from taxation)
Anglo French Joint Note of 8 January 1882 – expressed support for the Khedive and opposed growing
army influence – particularly French concern about the interests of bondholders. The army feared that
it was the prelude to an invasion.
11 June 1882 – riot in Alexandria against Europeans (50 killed)
11 July 1882 – British fleet bombarded Alexandria
Full scale revolt from the army led by Arabi Pasha – laid siege to Alexandria and threatened the canal
Gladstone wanted joint Anglo-French involvement but the French Assembly would not grant the
money.

~ 101 ~

August 1882 – British forces (led by Sir Garnet Wolseley) suppress Arabi Pasha’s rebellion → British
occupation of Egypt begins (defeat of Arabi Pasha at Tel-el-Kebir on 13 September)
Power vacuum – British occupation continued. Gladstone was ‘a reluctant imperialist’. (the whole
policy seemed to contradict the anti-imperial Midlothian campaign against ‘Beaconsfieldism’ in the
1880 election)
The French were annoyed that the British remained in Egypt. A temporary occupation that would last
for 70 years.
•

Dufferin Report and Evelyn Baring established as Consul-General – a ‘veiled protectorate’

Why did the British come to occupy Egypt in 1882?
Did the British intervene to protect bondholders or to protect the canal? Were the motives economic
or strategic? Chamberlain believes the latter.
Darwin – fear of loss of prestige after the Alexandria massacre – reminders of the Indian Mutiny
Strategic Consequences - Britain now had an extremely vulnerable possession in the Middle East that
could be threatened by Continental powers. Huge investment in the fleet to remain the dominant
power in the Mediterranean. The strategic corridor to Egypt and India was a vulnerable but vital centre
to Britain’s empire from the 1880s onwards. Rivalry with other powers prompted the calling of the
Berlin Conference in 1885.

•

Why did Britain occupy Egypt?

~ 102 ~

It has been contended by some historians, and strenuously denied by others, that the Anglo -French
estrangement over Egypt had repercussions all over Africa, that indeed it was the trigger that began
and unexpected and unintended chain reaction which resulted in the partition of tropical Africa among
the European great powers.
The Egyptian case attracted immense attention from later imperial theorists. To some, JA Hobson
among them, it went far to prove that the whole imperialist movement was financial in origin, a fraud
on the whole nation by a sectional interest. If this were the case then the insights gained from an
analysis of the Egyptian example would be generally applicable and would provide a general theory of
imperialism. Some writers have held that that was so. Others, however, have questioned it, pointing
out that the financial motives that are so obvious in Egypt are by no means so easily proven in tropical
Africa. If the latter school of thought is correct, Egypt must be treated as a special case, a unique
combination of strategic and financial interests, not a general explanation of imperialism, and other
cases must be investigated to see what pattern, if any, emerges from them.

ME Chamberlain, The Scramble for Africa (1999)

Why does Chamberlain suggest the 1882 occupation of Egypt is important to the wider
historiography of empire?

The occupation was the single most important forward movement made by Britain in the age of
partition which set in after 1880. There is no convincing evidence that it was undertaken primarily to
recoup the fortunes of British investors in Egyptian bonds. But, equally, it is too schematic t o argue
that it was merely the culmination of a long-standing interest in the safety of the route to India: a pure
question of strategy. The complex reaction to Egyptian politics in London did not spring from the wish
merely to conserve the existing strategic link with India, still less to recover funds… The leading
ministers, and the wider public who had celebrated Disraeli’s purchase of Canal Shares in 1875,
recognised that Britain’s stake in the Canal (and therefore in Egypt) was growing rapidly. An entire
shipping system was being built around it, and the commercial and military value of India was rising
steeply. The Canal was not the symbol of a decaying mid-Victorian pre-eminence, but of the dynamic
expansion of late-Victorian Britain… In the same way, the hard line towards Arabi reflected the latecentury view that economic and social progress was too urgent to be obstructed by Afro-Asian regimes
whose capacity for self-improvement was now regarded with ever heavier scepticism. In the decade
after 1882, Egypt became the test case for arguments about ‘progressive imperialism’ and the matrix
of a new imperial consensus on politics and strategy.

Egypt’s economy under British occupation:
•
•
•

•

•

The fiscal priority was to pay off debts and keep the government financially responsible. This
was always prioritised over domestic investment.
Industries owned by the khedive were sold off (usually to foreign investors).
63% of total exports went to Britain. There was a focus on developing the cotton industry
(mainly to export back to Lancashire): ½ million acres of desert were irrigated – Aswan Dam
(1902); cotton was 76% of all exports by 1880; 93% by 1912.
Large landowners benefitted from British rule – they consolidated their landholdings and
focused on export crops (i.e. cotton). Other crops (including food) were neglected and had
to be imported.
The peasant ‘fellahin’ classes often struggled and worked as employed labour on the
dominant, large farms. The population rose from 7 to 10 million which incre ased pressures
on food and land.

The immediate outcome of the occupation was to limit the income -generating possibilities of the
average Egyptian, and to displace many by non-Egyptians. It entrenched a new class system,
composed of large landowners, a business oligarchy, and small middle class of government
bureaucrats, and a large class of workers and peasants. It exacerbated the chasm between the elites
and the masses by encouraging foreign elements in the administration, and created groups with totally
different world outlooks as a consequence of different kinds of education and cultural upbringing.
Last, but not least, it inhibited industrialisation and the search for alternative sources of wealth while
entrenching a large landowning class depending for its income on the sale of cotton to Britain. For
Imperial Britain, the occupation provided a naval base and strengthened control of an indispensable
passage to Asia. It provided a market for British goods and a guaranteed source of raw materials for
British industries. Lastly, it acted as a safety valve for surplus youth, allowing young men to find
positions overseas that they could not have found at home.

What then kept the British in Egypt? Free passage through the Suez Canal appeared a compelling
reason since most of its traffic was British registered shipping. At no time in 1882 did the rebel leader
Arabi Pasha indicate that he would interfere with the running of the Canal, but there was no way of
knowing what Egyptian nationalists might do in the future. Most important of all, if Britain did nothing,
another power could step in. In the end, occupation was the only alternative to annexation by another
country. International developments in the late nineteenth century added weight to this argument.
•

Adapted from Lawrence James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire, 1994

The British government officially maintained that its occupation from 1882 was temporary. Britain’s
intention was to ‘rescue’ Egypt from ‘disorder’ and the Egyptian throne from a nationalist movement,
referred to as a ‘military mutiny’, and then to ‘retire’. However, in reality, there was no general
agreement or planned policy. While liberals anticipated rapid restoration of Egyptian political control,
hard-liners in Whitehall and men on the spot, notably Sir Evelyn Baring, argued otherwise. Strongly
supported by the Foreign Office, for over twenty years Baring persuaded successive Imperial
governments of the need to remain and reform, not only Egyptian finances, but a wide range of other
institutions.

Sudan is an area to the south of Egypt
which was formally under Egyptian
administration. This, therefore, became
an area of British interest after the
occupation of Egypt. The British sent
administrators to govern Sudan, based
in the capital Khartoum.
In June 1881 a rebellion broke out led
by an Islamic cleric called Muhammad
Ahmed, who proclaimed himself to be
the Mahdi – the final successor to
mankind. His extreme interpretation of
Islam and millenarian beliefs generated
a significant following in Sudan. He
created a jihadist movement to remove
outside influence from the country and,
by 1882, had taken control of much of
Sudan.

•
•

•

•

1883 – Colonel William Hicks launched a joint Anglo-Egyptian expedition to defeat the
Mahdists that was defeated.
1884 – General Charles Gordon was sent to evacuate British and Egyptian forces from
Khartoum. Instead, he resolved to defeat the Mahdist army, although the British were horribly
outnumbered.
1885 - Liberal Prime Minister, William Gladstone, eventually caved in to pressure to send a
relief force to Khartoum to help Gordon. However, it arrived too late and Gordon and his army
had already been overrun and killed.
The British withdrew from Sudan to avoid further loss of men and money.

As so often in the history of the empire, one thing led to another. By taking control of Egypt, the British
had also assumed responsibility for Sudan, the biggest country in Africa. Ministers were worried that
if they did not take control of that region, then the French might and with it the headwaters of the
Nile. There was the usual worry – in this case certainly nonsensical – about the risk to the Suez Canal
and there was the death of General Gordon to avenge. Britain’s involvement in Egypt and the Sudan
shows that not all empire was acquired by design. There was, of course, a large element of racial
prejudice in the self-appointed responsibility of the British which could not sit back when other races
were getting out of hand. Businessmen who believed their money was at risk roared on demands for
military action. The jingoism was shared by public opinion and whipped up by the press. Succumbing
to that pressure put the Sudan mission in the hands of the zealot, Kitchener who, like many empirebuilders, presented the task he had been given as a moral instruction.

The ‘Scramble for Africa’
Read:
•

pp. 17-19 in AQA

Context – International Relations: Germany became a united country in 1871, after a short war with
France. It quickly became an enormously powerful state, with considerable industrial potential and a
powerful military, headed by its Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. France recovered quickly from the war
and developed its armed forces. Russia continued to consolidate its hold over eastern and central Asia.
Italy also became a united country in 1870 and sought to take its place amongst the great powers. By
the 1870s Britain, therefore, faced several competitors; its domination of the seas and of the world
economy could no longer be taken for granted.
Context – ‘New Imperialism’ - By this point possession of colonies was considered a key attribute for
‘great power status’ – an overseas empire bestowed upon the metropolitan country great prestige
and, in this period of ‘new imperialism’, colonies were also popular with an increasingly literate and
politically-aware public. Some have argued that, as democratic participation expanded, imperialism
was a means by which elites could manipulate the public mood, unite the nation, and distract
populations from domestic matters (‘social imperialism’).
Context – the ‘Great Depression’: The 1870s also saw the onset of the ‘Great Depression’; a prolonged
period of lower economic growth which encouraged Europeans to look overseas for new markets and
raw materials. Germany and other states introduced a new system of tariffs as protectionism again
became a fashionable economic position. Africa was a continent which was still seen to have a great
deal of economic potential and, in a new era of tighter economic competition, control of African
territory was seen by many to be a crucial means of securing markets, raw materials and continuing
economic growth.
These developments in Europe, plus the expansion of British control into Egypt and North Africa,
helped to prompt what has become known as the ‘Scramble for Africa’ between c. 1880 and 1900; a
rapid carving-up of almost the entire continent into colonies controlled by different European powers.
The ‘scramble’ consisted of struggles between rival European powers, but also between European
powers and indigenous African peoples.

❖ How was the Scramble for Africa carried out? What principles underpinned it?
❖ What were some of the reasons for the Scramble for Africa?

~ 113 ~

Enablers of expansion:
Several technological and scientific developments meant that Europeans were enabled to take
possession of Africa where before this had been impossible:
•

•

•

Medical advances – in 1817 French scientists discovered quinine was a solution for malaria.
Links were also discovered between mosquitoes and yellow fever in the 1890s. These medical
advances meant that it was possible for Europeans to survive in Africa whereas beforehand
Africa had been known as ‘the white man’s grave’.
Transportation and communication advances – the development of the steamship and the
telegraph meant that troops, wealth and resources could be mobilised quickly. It also meant
that important waterways such as the Niger and the Congo were more easily navigable.
Railways would later also be an important means of transport and communication (e.g. Sudan
campaign, 1898)
Military advances – the invention of the breech-loading rifle and the machine gun (e.g. the
Maxim gun) gave the Europeans a temporary edge over African societies. This is perhaps most
obviously seen at the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. European defeats such as the British at
Isandlwana (1879) and the Italians at Adowa (1896) were extremely unusual.

Two Conferences:
On one level the ‘Scramble for Africa’ happened, not in Africa, but in diplomatic conferences in Europe
as the European powers carved up maps of the continent around the conference -room table:
•

The Brussels Conference, 1876 – Leopold II and the Congo

•

The Berlin Conference, 1884-85 – the principle of ‘effective occupation’

~ 114 ~

On a general level, there certainly was a change in the international atmosphere at the end of the
1870s, when the German government ended the era of free trade by introducing import duties into
Germany to protect domestic grain producers. International rivalries did intensify, as the steady
expansion of European possessions overseas began to create collisions between rival European
powers, for example in West Africa between the British, the French and the Belgians. The growing
penetration of indigenous economies by European traders and merchants increasingly produced
crises to which European powers now felt they had to respond by annexing territory. Nevertheless,
when all this is said, it remains very striking how quickly, how suddenly European powers decided to
divide Africa and key regions of the Pacific amongst themselves in the 1880s.
The key factor here was the foreign policy of the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The Iron
Chancellor was adamant that Germany did not need formal colonies for their own sake. They would,
he declared, mean unnecessary trouble and expense. “I am no man for colonies”, he said. But he did
think that the declaration of interests in particular potential colonies could be a useful bargaining point
in the European power-game. In 1883, Bismarck’s intervention in an already volatile colonial situation
turned a set of problems into a mad scramble for territory.
[Bismarck] began claiming colonies or rather declaring a German protectorate over key areas – Angra
Pequena in South-west Africa, where the German flag was raised in May 1884, Togoland and the
Cameroons in July 1884, New Guinea in December 1884, and East Africa, Tanganyika, in February
1885. Typically the moving forces on the ground were explorers – Gustav Nachtigal in West Africa, Carl
Peters in East Africa – and traders and planters. But they were all there was: they were not followed
by any significant involvement on the ground by the German state. In this way, the German Chancellor
demonstrated that you did not need actually to occupy a territory in order to annex it; he did not even
bother to send troops. This of course made annexation much easier than European states had thought.
Bismarck’s actions created something like a panic as European states rushed to annex their own
territories before somebody else got there first. Other states after all had existing claims to defend. To
underline his friendship with France and his new colonial policy, Bismarck agreed with the French
government to call a conference in Berlin on colonial claims, which met from November 1884 to
February 1885. It focused almost exclusively on the Congo, where it recognized the claim of Le opold
II, King of the Belgians, to annex it as his personal property, as well as ratifying the French claim to the
northern bank of the Congo river. Apart from this, however, it achieved nothing. Its declaration that a
claim to a colony required ‘effective occupation’ was a dead letter, since it applied only to coastal
areas, and its insistence on free trade along major rivers like the Congo and the Niger was more or less
ignored. But by laying down ground rules for annexation the conference effectively declared that the
scramble had begun, so it hugely stimulated further annexations.
- Richard Evans The Scramble for Africa Greshams College Lecture
❖ What does Evans argue about the Scramble for Africa?

~ 115 ~

In 1870 barely one tenth of Africa was under European control. By 1914 only about one tenth –
Abyssinia [Ethiopia] and Liberia – was not. Most of the partition of Africa, colloquially but accurately
described as the ‘scramble’ or ‘grab’ for Africa, had taken place during a period of only ten years
between the Berlin West African Conference of 1884-85 and a series of ‘tidying-up’ agreements in
1895-96. To the Victorians, this seemed not only natural but inevitable. One explanation is obvious.
Europe had undergone an industrial revolution and Africa had not. For the first time in History there
was an enormous gap, economic, technological and military, between the two continents with the
balance entirely in Europe’s favour. The second explanation is less obvious but equally important –
the mind-set of the Europeans. Europeans were at the forefront of progress and civilisation; Africans,
‘primitive’ and ‘backward’. Naturally the Europeans would take over. This was sometimes justified by
a debased form of ‘Social Darwinism’ which had little to do with what Charles Darwin had really argued
about ‘natural selection’ in the animal world.

ME Chamberlain, The Scramble for Africa
•
❖ What does Chamberlain argue in this extract about the Scramble for Africa?

The colonial powers superimposed their domains on the African Continent. The African politicogeographical map became a permanent liability that resulted from three months of ignorant, greedy
acquisitiveness, during a period when Europe’s search for minerals and markets had become
insatiable. The European colonial powers shared one objective in their African colonies: exploitation.

A few facts (taken from B Porter):
•
•

In the 1890s Britain did more trade with Belgium than it did with the whole of Africa.
1909 Trade:
o Imports from sub-Saharan Africa: £12.3 million
o Imports from Europe: £241.6 million
o Exports to sub-Saharan Africa: £25.8 million
o Exports to Europe: £119 million

British West Africa
Read:
➢ chapter 5 in Chamberlain
➢ pp. 296-306 in James
At the start of this period, Britain held four small colonies on the West African coast: Gambia, Sierra
Leone, the Gold Coast, and Nigeria. These colonies were economically rather unimportant as they
were essentially legacies of the eighteenth century trans-Atlantic slave trade. Since the 1830s it had
been the base from which the Royal Navy’s West Africa squadron pursued its worthy but difficult task
of trying to eradicate the slave trade. In 1865 there was a proposal to withdraw from these territories
completely. West Africa was largely an area of French interest, as well as growing German interest.
Partly because of this, the closing decades of the nineteenth century saw significant consolidation and
expansion into the hinterland of some of these areas. They remained important for British trade:
Gambia:
•
•

Surrounded by French Senegal – limited consolidation/ expansion
Proposals to exchange with the French for a more ‘useful’ area blocked by ‘Gambia lobby’ in
UK – supply of groundnuts

Gold Coast:

treaties in upper Niger – confrontations with French to establish boundaries.
1897 – a show of force by the Company army to assert control in upper Niger (use of Maxim
guns to intimidate) → Formation by Lugard of West African Frontier Force.
Boundaries fixed with French in 1898
Formal Crown control over North (1900) and South (1906) established (Company abolished)

From c. 1890 the Victorians saw an almost unbelievable revolution in their political relations with
Africa. Against all the trends of previous expansion, the British occupied Egypt and staked out a huge
tropical African empire. At the centre of this lies an apparent paradox. The main streams of British
trade, investment and migration continued to leave tropical Africa practically untouched; yet it was
tropical Africa that was bundled into empire. The flag was not following trade and capital; nor were
trade and capital as yet following the flag. The late Victorians seemed to be concentrating their
imperial effort in the continent of least importance to their prosperity. The collapse of African
governments under the strain of earlier Western influences may have played a part, even a
predominant part in the process. It is also quite possible that they did not acquire a new emp ire for
its intrinsic value, but because Africa’s relationship to their total strategy in Europe, the Mediterranean
or the East had altered.

South Africa – Context
The Boers and the British:
The first Europeans in South Africa were Dutch who settled in the Cape during the 18th century. They
became known as Boers (farmers), spoke a dialect of Dutch called Afrikaans and established
themselves as farmers in the area. They were a self-reliant people who subscribed to a strict form of
Protestantism. During the Napoleonic Wars the British took the Cape off the Dutch between 1795 and
1815 and Cape Colony became a British colony. Before the opening of the Suez Canal, possession of
the Cape was of strategic importance to Britain as it lay directly on the sea route to India where British
ships could refuel. British settlers arrived in the Cape after 1815 and also in the colony of Natal which
was annexed in 1845
Many Boers resented British rule and, from 1835, large numbers migrated north, inland, in what was
known as the ‘Great Trek’. They established their own states, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal,
which the British recognised in the 1850s. Nevertheless, whether the Boers were formally
independent from Britain remained ambiguous and tensions between the British and the Boer
republics developed considerably in the second half of the 19th century.
The Bantu:
Aside from European settlers, South Africa was also home to large numbers of native Africans. There
was (and is) a large number of different ethnic groups that include the Xhosa and Zulu tribes.
Collectively, they were known as the Bantu peoples as a generic term for the 300-600 different
linguistic groups who inhabited the region from the African Great Lakes down to the Cape. As their
dominance in South Africa grew over the later 19th century, the British also came into conflict with
several Bantu peoples.

Tension with the Transvaal and the Orange Free State had been escalating since the Jameson fiasco.
Simple mineral wealth, the fabled gold and diamond deposits was not the main issue. South Africa
was of vital geopolitical importance because it served as the crucial hinterland of the naval base at
Durban from which the route to India was defended. It could not be allowed to fall into the hands of
another European power, especially Germany, which was already ensconced to the north -east (in
present-day Tanzania) and north-west (in present-day Namibia). Knowing that annexation was on the
cards, Kruger decided to strike first.

Brendan Simms, Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy (2014)

Britain did not go to war in 1899 because of its existing or future stake in the Transvaal, which was not
thought to be at risk, but because it feared the political consequences of the growing economic power
of the Transvaal for the region as a whole. The British government did not go to war to protect British
trade or the profits of capitalists in the Transvaal. It was not only there that capitalists suffered at the
hands of an inefficient and corrupt government. Political control of the Transvaal was not sought in
order to control the gold-mines, nor to supply access to the supply of gold which would continue to
flow to London as the bullion and financial capital of the world. It was not gold that Britain was after
in 1899 but the establishment of British power and influence over the Transvaal on a firmer basis to
advance the unification of the region within the British Empire.

The Oxford History of the British Empire: The Nineteenth Century, 1999

The South African War of 1899–1902 marked the completion of a process begun in the 1870s. The
British conquest of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State paved the way for a single South African
state. There has been much debate about the causes of the war. Imperial rivalry with a growing
Afrikaner nationalism and with other European powers, especially Germany, defence of the sea route
to India and the ambitions of particular individuals such as Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary,
Rhodes, the Cape Prime Minister, and Milner, the British High Commissioner, all played a role, but the
essential catalyst was economic. Whereas the conquests of the 1870s and 1880s were fuelled by the
diamond discoveries, the South African War was caused by the development of gold mining on the
Witwatersrand. This made the region one which Britain, fearful of the industrial and imperial rivals of
the late nineteenth century, was unable to ignore.

‘Native Policy ’, colonial development and the impact of colonial rule
Read:
➢ pp. 153-163 in Porter & pp. 186-191 in Porter
➢ chapters 7 & 8 in Levine
‘Native policy’ was the phrase used to describe British policy towards the indigenous (i.e. nonEuropean) peoples of the empire. In practice, policy would vary across time and place; there was no
such thing as a ‘typical’ colony and, therefore, no such thing as a ‘typical’ native policy. In addition,
attitudes of British administrators, both in London and in the colonies, developed considerably
between the mid-19th century and the mid-20th century. Native policy would depend on Britain’s
interest and priorities in the colony, and policy would often cover a range of sometimes contradictory
ideas. The ‘policy’ of officials might differ from British business interests or British missionaries.
Complicating matters further, changing British concepts of race also led British administrators to make
simplistic assumptions as to the appropriate treatment of different ethnic groups.
The Native Policy within a particular colony would then determine the scale of the impact of colonial
rule on the indigenous population, both in economic and cultural terms. In some places colonial rule
came as a profound disruption to traditional patterns of life in Africa and Asia, whereas in other places
colonial rule had a lighter, more subtle impact. Most obviously, colonies where Europeans settled
tended to disrupt the lives of the indigenous peoples much more significantly than colonies where
traditional societies and political structures were left more-or-less intact through a system of ‘indirect
rule’. Identifying complete consistency in what John Darwin calls the ‘Unfinished Empire’ is impossible.
However, it may be possible to identify some common patterns.
The following are the central questions to consider:
➢ How did Britain rule its colonial possessions? To what extent did they rely on
collaboration? Was there any consistency?
➢ What cultural impact did Britain have on its possessions?
➢ What was the economic relationship between Britain and its colonial possessions? Was it
purely exploitative?

~ 136 ~

Both sides came to rely on a form of political bargain, or what has sometimes been called
‘collaborative politics’. Collaboration allowed local elites to protect their own social privileges and
helped them to control the vertical links binding their districts to imperial rule. Many communities,
tribes and individuals were well placed to offer their services – as soldiers, clerks, policemen and
teachers – to the colonial regime and reap the reward. The limits on their manpower meant the British
had to rely on collaboration with indigenous teachers, clerics and lawgivers. This was all the more
necessary because the British were obsessed with the need to codify. They wanted fixed schedules of
rights and claims so that their men on the spot should not be too much in the dark. They consulted
learned men and turned to chiefs, scholars, and native lawyers for help. Thus, far from assaulting local
traditions, the British more often allied with interested parties to fabricate a ‘traditional’ order, in
which the past was re-invented to suit the mutual convenience of both parties.

John Darwin, Unfinished Empire, 2013

❖ What point does Darwin make about administration in the colonies?
❖ From your own knowledge, did this form of administration apply in all cases?

The larger African kingdoms had all imposed tight economic constraints, so British colonial rule acted
as a liberating force. The British generally desired a free labour market; in the imperial scheme of
things there was accordingly no place for domestic slavery. Imperial rule and the demands of a wider
market economy did away with the restrictions on trade and production imposed by indigenous
authorities. Imperial rule involved a vast transfer of physical and human capital to Africa, and colonial
Africa benefited from enormous public and private investments. However, there were generally too
few capitalists rather than too many and, for many colonies, it was not the extent of business
enterprise that was the problem, but its relative absence.

influential administration of Northern Nigeria in 1900–06, and his amalgamation of the two Nigerias
into one administrative entity in 1912–18. The consequences of both Nigerian exercises were
identifiable long after his death and into the country's independence. His ultimate objective, running
through The Dual Mandate, was progressively to prepare colonial peoples for some form of self -rule,
yet to be defined in detail, under a tutelage which would give prominence to their own cultural
institutions without the deracinating impact of premature modernization through European
influences. The key lay in gradualism—his own precept of festina lente—and in his confidence that
this could best be achieved under British rule. At the same time, his experience left him in no doubt
that the best results could be gained only through the maximum measure of responsibility being
devolved by Whitehall to its man on the spot.

Historiography: Explaining Empire
The reasons for European imperialism have been much debated, particularly the flourish of
imperialism in the later 19th Century associated with the ‘Scramble for Africa.’ Generally, historians of
imperialism recognise multi-causal explanations. However, they place emphasis on certain factors
they consider to be important. Generally, they either tend to emphasise the metropole (i.e. Britain) in
explaining imperialism, or they tend to emphasise events in the periphery (i.e. the colonies):

J.A. Hobson, Imperialism: A Study (1902)
Seeing that the Imperialism of the last six decades is clearly
condemned as a bad business policy, in that at enormous expense it
had procured a small, bad, unsafe increase of markets, and had
jeopardised the entire wealth of the nation in rousing the strong
resentment of other nations, we may ask, ‘How is the British nation
induced to embark upon such unsound business?’ The only possible
answer is that the business interests usurp control of national
resources and use them for their private gain… Careful analysis of the
existing relations between business and politics shows that the
aggressive imperialism which we seek to understand is not in the
main the product of blind passions of races or of the mixed folly and
ambition of politicians… It is not too much to say that the modern foreign policy of Great Britain has
been primarily a struggle for profitable markets of investment. To a larger extent every year Great
Britain has been becoming a nation living upon tribute from abroad, and the classes who enjoy this
tribute have had an ever-increasing incentive to employ the public policy, the public purse, and the
public force to extend the field of their private investment, and to safeguard and improve their existing
investments.

Popular imperialism [was] a depraved choice of national life. It is only the competing cliques of
businessmen that are forcing the Empire to the top of the political agenda. Imperialism is motivated
not by the interests of the nation but by those of certain classes who impose the policy of the nation
for their own advantage. Imperialism also favours the general cause of Conservatism by diverting
public interest and attention away from domestic agitation and the tension it causes in international
relations encourages military expenditure and provides a justification for not implementing social
reform.

VV.I. Lenin, Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917)
It is characteristic of capitalism in general that the ownership of capital is
separated from the application of capital to production, that money
capital is separated from industrial or productive capital, and that the
rentier who lives entirely on income obtained from money capital, is
separated from the entrepreneur and from all who are directly
concerned in the management of capital. Imperialism, or the domination
of finance capital, is that highest stage of capitalism at which this
separation reaches vast proportions…
Typical of the old capitalism, when free competition had undivided sway,
was the export of goods. Typical of the latest stage of capitalism, when
monopolies rule, is the export of capital…
It goes without saying that if capitalism… could raise the standard of living of the masses, who are
everywhere still half-starved and poverty-stricken, in spite of the amazing technical progress, there
could be no talk of a surplus, of capital… But if capitalism did these things it would not be capitalism…
As long as capitalism remains what it is, surplus capital will be utilised not for the purpose of raising
the standard of living of the masses in a given country, for this would mean a decline in profits for the
capitalists, but for the purpose of increasing profits by expanding capital abroad to backwards
countries…
But when nine-tenths of Africa had been seized (by 1900), when the whole world had been divided
up, there was inevitably ushered in the era of monopoly ownership of colonies and, consequently, of
particularly intense struggle for the division and redivision of the world…
From all that has been said in this book on the economic esse nce of imperialism, it follows that we
must define it as capitalism in transition or, more precisely as moribund capitalism.

Ronald Hyam, Britain’s Imperial Century (1976)
The economic impulse was to find markets and outlets for the new
manufacturing potential set in motion by industrialization, together
with an increased need to find the raw materials to feed it. Britain
became the 'works hop of the world' and entrepreneurs looked well
beyond the confines of their homeland. I t is important, however, not
to pre-date the movement into many overseas regions; some did not
feel the impact before the 1850s. The industrial revolution proceeded
by a process of anticipating potential demand overseas. Where demand
did not exist, as among the unclothed inhabitants in Africa, it could be
created.
Without a doubt the products of Manchester and Birmingham spread widely and sources of supply
were also remarkably diffuse. W S Jevons in The Coal Question' (1865) enthused: The plains of North
America and Russia are our corn fields; Australasia contains our sheep farms; the Hindus and the
Chinese grow tea for us, and our coffee, sugar and spice plantations are in all the Indies' Here we see
the intoxication of a sense of world mastery, the exciting feeling of having organized the entire world for
the purpose of satisfying the needs of the expanding British economy.
Above all, it was Palmerston who led the movement into exotic new regions. He pointed out, 'One way in
which a government may assist the commerce of the country is by opening new markets for our trade'
The foundations of a vast new opening for commerce had, he hoped, been laid in C hina. Securing
so big a market for British manufacturers, was, he claimed, a matter of the highest importance. The
solution to domestic distress, said Palmerston, was the extension of foreign trade. The dynamic vision
which drove exertions forward was based for example on the expectation of British manufacturers
that all the mills of Lancashire could not make stocking stuff sufficient for one of the provinces of China.
A market of over 300 million people was a tempting prospect.
The Victorians had a tremendous sense of being in some way in harmony with the progressive forces
of the universe. God was on their side. Prince Albert regarded the 1851 Exhibition as a festival of
Christian civilization. There was a general conviction that the British had reached the top of the ladder
of progress, and that it was their duty to improve the lot of others. The usual British attitude to foreigners
was that expressed by Dickens' Mr Podsnap, that other countries were a 'mistake'. More important
were the views of Palmerston. He rejoiced in nature's favours, the people's virtues and the blessings
of British freedom. He declared, 'Our duty is not to enslave, but to set free, and I may say tha t we
stand at the head of moral, social and political civilization.' Upon what facts did this confidence rest?
Upon four, mainly. First, upon economic pre-eminence. Second, upon the unchallengeable power of the
British navy. Third, upon internal stability. Fourth, underpinning everything there was a deep religious
justification and driving force. To a remarkable extent the ideological motive for expansion was religious.
Ideologically the Victorian desire was to improve the rest of the world by a programme of Christian
regeneration, spreading civilization on the British model. This was, they believed, the only perfection
open to mankind, and it was God-ordained.

Gallagher and Robinson, Africa and the Victorians (1961)
In all the long annals of imperialism, the partition of Africa is a
remarkable freak. Few events that have thrown an entire continent into
revolution have been brought about so casually… It used to be supposed
that European society must have put our stronger urges to empire in
Africa at this time; and all sorts of causes have been suggested to
support the supposition. One and all, however, they suffer from a
tiresome defect: of powerful new incentives there is remarkably little
sign. Only after the partition was longer over and done with did capital
seek outlets, did industry seek markets in tropical Africa. As late as the
end of the century the European economy went on by-passing these
poor prospects in favour of the proven fields of America and Asia.
Neither is it realistic to explain the movement by some change in the temper of the European mind.
The pride and pomps of African empire did not suit the popular taste until late in the 1890s when the
partition was all but completed… Scanning Europe for the causes, the theorists of imperialism have
been looking for answers in the wrong places. The crucial changes that set all working took place in
Africa itself. It was the fall of an old power [the Khedivate in Egypt] in its north, the rise of a new [the
Transvaal] in its south, that dragged Africa into modern history… Imbroglios with Egyptian protonationalists and thence with Islamic revivals across the whole of the Sudan drew the powers into an
expansion of their own in East and West Africa… The last quarter of the century has often been called
the ‘Age of Imperialism’. Yet much of this imperialism was no more than an involuntary reaction of
Europe to the various proto-nationalisms of Islam that were already rising in Africa against the
encroaching thraldom of the white men…
[The gaudy empires spatch-cocked together] have fallen to pieces only three-quarters of a century
after being thrown together. It would be a gullible historiography which could see such gimcrack
creations as necessary functions of the balance of power or as the highest stage of capitalism.

At the centre of late-Victorian imperialism in Africa lies an apparent paradox. The main streams of
British trade, investment and migration continued to leave British tropical Africa practically untouched;
and yet it was tropical Africa that was now bundled into the empire. The late -Victorians seemed to be
concentrating their imperial effort in the continent of least importance to their prosperity.
It cannot be taken for granted that positive impulses from European society or the European economy
were alone in starting up imperial rivalries. The collapse of African governments under the strain of
previous Western influences may have played a part. Hence, crises in Africa, no less than imperial
ambitions and international rivalries in Europe, have to be taken into account. Allowance has also to be
made for the diversity of interest and circumstance in the different regions of Africa. It seems unlikely

~ 144 ~

that the motives in regions as different as Egypt, the Niger and South Africa can be fitted easily into a
single, simple formula of 'imperialism'.
A first task in analyzing the late-Victorians' share in the partition is to understand the motives of the
ministers who directed it. Policy-making was a reading of the long-run national interest which stayed
much the same from government to government. This is not to say that they were fully aware of the
forces at work. Their recorded assumptions did not always bring out fully their unconscious assumptions.
What is more, there are many things too well understood between colleagues to be written down.
There is no denying limitations to the study of how and why policy was decided.
Did new, sustained or compelling impulses towards African empire arise in British politics or business
during the 1880s? The businessman saw no greater future there, except in the south. The evidence
seems unconvincing. The late-Victorians seem to have been no keener to rule and develop Africa than
their fathers. Their territorial claims were not made for the sake of African empire or commerce as such.
They were little more than by-products of an enforced search for better security in the
Mediterranean and the East. It was national safety that moved the ruling elite.
Why could the late-Victorians after 1880 no longer rely upon influence to protect traditional interests?
What forced the late-Victorians into imperial solutions? The answer is to be found in the nationalist
crises in Africa itself. From start to finish the partition of tropical Africa was driven by persistent crisis in
Egypt. By 1882 the Egyptian government had cracked. It was the internal nationalist reaction
against a decaying government which switched European rivalries into Africa. Britain's overriding
purpose in Africa was security in Egypt, the Mediterranean and the Orient.
Because it went far ahead of commercial expansion and imperial ambition, because its aims were
essentially defensive and strategic, the movement into Africa remained superficial. That British
governments before 1900 did very little to pacify, administer and develop their spheres of influence
shows the weaknesses of any commercial and imperial motives for claiming them. The partition
preceded the invasion of tropical Africa by the trader, the planter and the official. It was the extension of
territorial claims which in time required commercial expansion.

~ 145 ~

Cain and Hopkins, British Imperialism (1993 + later edns)
Nowhere does the weight of historiography press so insistently upon the
study of imperialism as in the case of the partition of Africa… Marxist and
Marxisant interpretations have performed particularly badly… largely
because of their failure to relate partition to the realities of capitalist
development. Liberal interpretations have flourished on the diversity
revealed by recent research [but] to claim that imperialism was the result
of crises on the periphery is to report the symptoms, not to diagnose the
cause.
By 1900… Britain had secured the most valuable parts of Africa… Just as
there are well-known difficulties in finding ‘surplus’ capital and
conspiracies of bond-holders, so there are equally serious problems with the currently influential view
that Britain was an ageing, defensive power struggling to fend off new challenges to her dominance.
The interpretation advanced here suggests that Britain had independent reasons for taking action to
increase her grip on Africa. The impulses motivating policy can be traced to the metropole… The main
weight of her interests lay in Egypt and Southern Africa, where City and service interests were most
prominently represented, and it was there that Britain showed the greatest vigour in promoting her
claims.

Our own argument will be that the central weakness in existing accounts of imperialism is that
they underplay the relationship between the British economy and Britain's presence abroad.
Putting the metropolitan economy at the centre of the analysis makes it possible to establish a
new framework.
The imperial mission was the export version of the gentlemanly order. The empire was a superb
arena for gentlemanly endeavour, the ultimate testing ground for the idea of responsible
progress, for the battle against evil, for the performance of duty, and for the achievement of
honour. We have constructed a central proposition, based on gentlemanly capitalism, and tested
it against various case studies.
The character and purpose of Britain's presence on the moving frontiers of e mpire can be fully
understood only by linking events in diverse parts of the world to causes that can be traced back
to the metropole itself. Our own interpretation attempts to connect metropole and periphery by
linking innovations in the finance and service sector to the priorities that shaped Britain's presence
abroad. One of these innovations was the rise of gentlemanly activities centred on London. City
finance performed a vital function of integrating countries that lacked adequate capital markets
of their own. By funding export development overseas, the City enabled newly incorporated
regions to raise an increasing volume of foreign loans. The City acquired a world role, and Lo ndon
became the centre of a system of global payments.

~ 146 ~

The impulses drawing Britain overseas merged economic considerations with a wider programme
of development that aimed at raising the standard of civilisation as well as the standard of living.
The colonies of white settlement fell more firmly under British influence during the second half of
the nineteenth century. As they increased their formal political independence, so they became
reliant on flows of British capital to an extent that limited their freedom of action. A very similar
pattern can be discerned in the case of the South American republics, where British finance was
heavily involved in funding the apparatus of government as well as the growth of exports, thereby
helping them both to build new nation states and to subordinate them to external control. As
Disraeli observed, 'Colonies do not cease to be colonies because they are independent.'
We have questioned the widespread and long-standing assumption linking the 'triumph of industry'
to imperialist expansion, and have emphasised instead the role of finance. Shifting the basis of
causation has also required us to reconsider some of the standard divisions of imperial history.
Linking imperialism to the process of industrialisation has produced a number of well-known
landmarks: an informal empire in the mid-Victorian era followed by the defensive imperialism of
a declining power. In fact, Britain's informal influence was growing at precisely the time when it is
thought to have been in decline. Britain's strategy still lay in the hands of officers and gentlemen
whose vision of a world order managed from London remained undimmed.

The explorers Burton and Stanley were unusual individuals, but in their
views and writings both gave pointed expression to shifting attitudes
towards Africa and Africans. European ideas of African culture were
increasingly formed by new ideological currents against which Britain
assessed herself and her experience of Africa. These included a
burgeoning power and concomitant sense of a superior British destiny,
reinforced by imperial gains elsewhere and underpinned by the
sedulous rise of pseudo-scientific racism; a growing confidence that
Africa might be civilised in its own interest, not simply by missionary
enterprise and free trade but also by exposing its peoples to all of the
many ordering technologies and secular disciplines of modern bourgeois life. As corollaries, the failure
to effect wholesale Christian conversion despite the expenditure of money, effort, and lives, the lack
of success in fostering an export-oriented plantation economy, the continuing stain of the slave trade,
despite abolition (now combined with more information – and misinformation – about the extent and
nature of African domestic slavery), and the presumed barbarism of great African states and cultures
(Asante, Dahomey, Buganda, the Congo) were all intimations that, perhaps, Africans were
irredeemable if left to govern themselves. Such ideas were the prelude to the Imperial Age in Africa.

ME Chamberlain, The Scramble for Africa (1974)
Over-arching theories are still in retreat before multi-causal
explanations. The defence of India or a rear-guard defence of declining
economy might offer a plausible reason for British actions but can
hardly be extrapolated to other Powers. More intangible factors may
be due for reassessment. The mind-set of late Victorians is so alien to
the world view of Europeans (especially young Europeans) in the 21 st
Century that it can be almost incomprehensible. Yet it was the milieu
in which the Victorians operated. Imperialism was believed to be right
in the sense that it was in the national interest. It was believed to be
right in other ways too. It was benefiting the ‘backward’ native,
bringing him up to the standards of western civilisation. This made
imperialism attractive to many liberals and humanitarians… Imperialism was accepted as right in a
third way too. Although some intellectuals raised doubts, most people in the late nineteenth century
accepted the idea of progress in human affairs as self-evident. Theories of evolution were generally
applied to societies. Western societies were further advanced than African or Asian societies. It was
both proper and inevitable that the more advanced would conquer and rule the less advanced. In the
end it would be to the advantage of both. But above all it was inescapable. Many imperialists – Cecil
Rhodes was perhaps the most striking example – felt that they were in tune with the zeitgeist, the
spirit of history, and this gave them both a comforting assurance that they were on the winning side
and a kind of absolution for any dubious acts they might have to commit in fulfilling an inevitable and
ultimately benevolent destiny.

Brendan Simms, Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy, 1543
to the Present (2013)
Throughout the late nineteenth century, the great powers engaged
in imperial expansion and reorganisation to secure manpower,
economic resources, territory and prestige which could be
deployed against European rivals… Imperialism was not just a
geopolitical, but also an ideological project: the two motivations
were inseparably intertwined, especially in Africa. The existing
colonies were constantly threatened by the instability of
neighbouring states and tribes. Colonial powers now applied a
principle which they had long practised on their own continent.
When a state became ‘permanently anarchic and defenceless’, the
long-serving Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury,
remarked with reference to Europe, neighbouring states were
obliged to impose either a ‘tutelage of ambassadors’ or ‘partition’… British strategists sought to
neutralise the predatory Zulus, and the equally restive Afrikaners to the north of the Cape Province.
Above all, the great powers wanted to fill the vast ‘vacuum’ in the African interior, partly to secure
their existing colonies against attacks from that quarter, partly to secure its resources and partly to
pre-empt their rivals. Central to this project was the campaign to abolish the East African slave trade,
which was seen not only as a moral imperative by many Europeans, but also as necessary to the
establishment of good governance and stability across the continent. Here British naval measures had
proved unsuited to stopping the Arab trade, which was carried on in thousands of small boats across
the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. If the Africans were to be freed from the curse of bondage, and civilised
norms were to prevail, there would have to be a robust ‘continental’ expansion into the belly of the
beast, to smash the Arab slave emirates and their local black African auxiliaries. British public opinion
would accept nothing less. The alternatives for the local populations were Arab slavery or European
colonialism and the choice would be made for them, either way.
All this made central Africa briefly the fulcrum of European geopolitics. The French pressed in from
the north-west, the British from the south and north-east. Bismarck feared that the Congo basin would
become the source of coloured soldiers which the French would use against him in Europe. The map
of Africa was closing in on him. He therefore called a conference of European powers in Berlin, which
met from December 1884 to late February 1885 to discuss the future of the area, and to ensure the
neutralisation of the Congo basin in the event of war. In the resulting ‘scramble’ most of the continent
was divided up.

~ 150 ~

Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Empire (1987)
Essentially strategic explanations of imperialism have attracted
some historians, who have tried to account for the British expansion
in Africa in terms of the need to defend the routes to, and the
maritime and terrestrial glacis of, India against potential threats. It
is indeed important to recall that, speaking globally, India was the
core of British strategy, and that this strategy required control not
only over the short sea-routes to the subcontinent (Egypt, the
Middle East, the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and South Arabia) and the
long sea-routes (the Cape of Good Hope and Singapore), but over
the entire Indian Ocean, including crucial sectors of the African coast
and its hinterland. British governments were keenly aware of this. It
is also true that the disintegration of local power in some areas
crucial for this purpose, such as Egypt (including the Sudan), drew
the British into establishing a much greater direct political presence than originally intended, and even
into actual rule. Yet these arguments do not invalidate an economic analysis of imperialism. In the first
place, they underestimate the directly economic incentive to acquire some African territories, of
which Southern Africa is the most obvious. In any case the scramble for West Africa and the Congo
was primarily economic. In the second place they overlook the fact that India was the ‘brightest jewel
in the imperial crown’ and the core of British global strategic thinking precisely because of her very
real importance to the British economy… In the third place, the disintegration of indigenous local
governments, which sometimes entailed the establishment of European rule over areas Europeans
had not previously bothered to administer, was itself due to the undermining of local structures by
economic penetration. And, finally, the attempt to prove that nothing in the internal development of
western capitalism in the 1880s explains the territorial re-division of the world fails, since world
capitalism in this period clearly was different from what it had been in the 1860s. It now consisted of
a plurality of rival ‘national economies’ ‘protecting’ themselves against each other. In short, politics
and economics cannot be separated in a capitalist society…The attempt to devise a purely non economic explanation of the ‘new imperialism’ is unrealistic.

~ 151 ~

In the early 1880s, the slow movement towards an Anglo-French partition of West Africa, arising from
the commercial penetration of the interior, was both speeded up and complicated by the appearance
on the African scene of new European powers which had not previously shown any interest in Africa.
The result of these interventions was to force all the European powers, including Britain, to look
beyond their immediate economic needs. Each power felt compelled to enter the scramble for
territory in order to reserve the largest possible sphere for its own future activities.
•

Adapted from Roland Oliver and Anthony Atmore, Africa since 1800, 1981

Britain’s part in the African scramble was driven by the overwhelming need to preserve the Suez route
to the old Empire in India and Australasia. There is no doubt that many British statesmen and military
leaders became obsessed with the need to protect the Indian Empire from the imagined foreign
threat, and thus by the need to secure the Suez Canal during the last two decades of the nineteenth
century. In this sense, imperial expansion in Africa was essentially defensive, and a new empire was
brought into being to protect the old.

Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments
in these two extracts are in relation to British expansion in Africa in the late nineteenth
century?

Colonisation was not produced by any blind ‘structural forces’ but was consciously decided by men;
historical human agents working for a variety of motives and reasons. And the men who made the
ultimate historical decisions on the partition of Africa were neither industrialists nor other capitalists,
nor lobbyists, but holders of state power. They were sovereigns, top ministers and a handful of high
officials in the major European countries. The partition of Africa was essentially a state action, not a
private venture. If there is one conclusion which emerges from the extensive study of diplomatic
correspondence, it is that the men who embodied the official mind were not thinking as much in terms
of rates of profit and monetary inputs and outputs, as in terms of power and prestige and, ultimately,
war and peace. It is not for nothing that the historians of diplomacy are fond of speaking of the
‘chessboard of European power politics.’

The empire in mid-19 t h Century British politics
In the mid-19th Century Britain was the dominant economic and
naval power in the world. As has been seen, it possessed a
substantial colonial inheritance. Nevertheless, it did not consciously
think of itself as an imperial power; ‘imperialism’ was associated with
the despotism of empires in the past, and the contemporary French
Empire of Napoleon III (1848-1870). By contrast, Britain prided itself
on its liberal and parliamentary traditions, as well as its embrace of
free trade.
There was no plan to manage Britain’s colonial possessions as one
coherent unit, nor was there much appetite (in London at least) for
expansion. Instead, British politicians hoped to advance Britain’s
interests through the methods ‘informal empire’, intervening only where necessary. In terms of
acquiring territory, this period can be regarded as an era of indifference.
Yet, that is not to say that British politicians did not believe in acting robustly in the national interest.
The Whig/ Liberal politician Lord Palmerston (above) dominated politics and foreign affairs in the mid 19th Century (Foreign Secretary 1830-34; 1835-41; 1846-51, Prime Minister 1855-58; 1859-65). He
generally sought to avoid British entanglements in European affairs. He was supportive of liberal
movements in autocratic countries and also of nationalist movements in Belgium and Italy. He
opposed to the growing power of France and sought to maintain the European ‘balance of power’ as
so many of his predecessors had also done. Part of this included the traditional British policy of
maintaining support for the Ottoman Empire to prevent Russian influence spreading towards the
Mediterranean. Indeed, the only major war in this period was the Crimean War (1854-56).
Moreover, Palmerston was associated with the principles of ‘gunboat diplomacy’; the use of force to
maintain Britain’s interests, as seen in the Don Pacifico Affair (1850) and the First Opium War against
China (1839-42) which was fought to ensure British access to Chinese markets. Although Britain had a
small (by European standards) standing army, her navy remained the pre -eminent force on the high
seas and ensured that her colonial possessions and trade routes were secure.
It was only in the 1860s and 1870s that the empire began to appear as a regular theme in British
politics and culture. Partly this was a consequence of the expansion of the franchise extending to
working class men with the Second Reform Act of 1867 which engaged ordinary people in matters of
global interest. Colonial matters became much more important to British foreign policy as other
European countries grew in power and became imperial rivals. In part it was the impact or shock of
colonial events such as the Indian Mutiny or the Jamaican Rebellion, or the fascination in the exploits
of individuals such as David Livingstone. The growing interest in colonial matters was exploited by
politicians, particularly in the Conservative Party, who could promote ‘imperialism’ as a positive policy;
as the Victorian age wore on, empire became a contested matter of party politics.

The Irish Question
Ireland had been controlled by the English Crown since the Middle Ages. Indeed, it can be seen as the
first example of English colonialism; after the Reformation, an anglicised Protestant minority
dominated Irish politics and society and were the principal landowners. Ireland was rarely a settled
place and resistance to British rule led to a rebellion in 1798. The result of this was the Act of Union in
1800 which formally incorporated Ireland into the United Kingdom and gave it representation at
Westminster.
Nevertheless, there was widespread hostility in Ireland to British rule. This was exacerbated by the
terrible famine of the 1840s which saw the Irish population plummet as millions either died or
emigrated. The misery of the Irish rural population fed demands for greater autonomy. The view from
London tended to be to hope that the ‘Irish Question’ would disappear through a mixture of economic
reforms and coercion. However, from the 1860s onwards a substantial body of Irish Nationalist MPs
demanded ‘Home Rule’ for Ireland within the empire.
After deciding that ‘pacifying Ireland’ was his ‘mission’, Gladstone came out in favour of Home Rule
as a solution to the Irish Question and tried to steer a Home Rule Bill through Parliament in 1886, and
again in 1893. Each time it was blocked by the Conservatives and a substantial group of Liberal
Unionists, led by Joseph Chamberlain. The situation was complicated by the fact that a large
proportion of the Irish population in Ulster (the north of the island) were Protestant and determined
to remain part of the Union.
The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists (who would later merge to form the Conservative and
Unionist Party) saw Irish Home Rule as the first step to breaking up the British Empire; if Britain
couldn’t maintain of territory closest to it, then it
had little hope of maintaining the rest of the
Empire. There was a fear that nationalist ideas
could spread from Ireland to other parts of the
world. Chamberlain, instead, believed/ hoped that
his dreams of Imperial Federation would solve the
Irish Question in a different way.
Tensions in Ireland rose in the first decade of the
20th Century. The Liberal Government (from 1906)
was determined to introduce Home Rule while the
Conservative and Unionists encouraged Loyalists
in Ulster to fight to remain part of the Union:
‘Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right’.
A third Home Rule Bill was passed in 1912 and its
enactment looked set to start a civil war in Ireland.
However, it was suspended on the outbreak of the
First World War in 1914 – an alternative solution
to the Irish Question would emerge from that
conflict.

Imperial & Foreign Policy and Victorian Public Opinion: Two Case Studies
Governor Eyre and the Jamaican Rebellion of 1865:
By the mid-19th century, relations between the 15,000 strong white
population of Jamaica and the c. ½ million black population there were
strained. Since the abolition of slavery in 1834, the Jamaican economy had
stagnated and unemployment was high among the black population.
Meanwhile political power remained in the hands of the whites through an
elected assembly. Riots and disturbances occurred with increasing frequency
and these culminated in a riot in Morant Bay in which several white officials
were killed. Memories of the Indian Mutiny were fresh. The Governor, Edward
Eyre, anticipated a widespread rebellion and responded with ferocity: he
declared martial law in Western Jamaica and imposed a reign of terror on the
black population: hundreds were hanged and flogged after summary trials,
many of whom were almost certainly innocent of any hand in the earlier riots.
New of Eyre’s actions sharply divided the British public. The humanitarian lobby called for Eyre’s immediate
recall and his trial for murder. In response, there were those who hailed Eyre as a hero who had saved the
vulnerable white population from another Indian Mutiny. Public figures threw their weight behind each
argument: Charles Dickens and Thomas Carlyle supported Eyre, whereas John Stuart Mill and Charles
Darwin condemned him. While some focused on the sufferings of the black victims of Eyre’s regime, others
became convinced of the need to treat the non-white populations of the empire with a firm hand. The
debate rumbled on throughout 1866 until Eyre was sacked but, when he returned, the new Tory
government refused to indict him and he retired from public service.

The Eastern Crisis of 1876-78:
In 1876 there was a rebellion by Christians in Bulgaria against Ottoman (and therefore Islamic) rule there.
The Ottomans responded with ferocity and massacred the civilian population. In Britain, public opinion was
outraged; William Gladstone (then in opposition) moved into action denouncing the ‘Bulgarian Horrors’
and demanding that Britain end its support for the Ottoman regime. Instead, he argued, Britain should
support the Christian populations of the Balkans who were struggling for independence. For Gladstone,
humanity was more important than propping up the Ottomans to secure the route to India.
Portraying itself as the defender of the Balkan Christians, Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in
1877 and was remarkably successful: it pushed back the Ottomans almost to Constantinople and then
imposed a harsh peace, leaving Russia as the dominant power in the Balkans and the Near East. Public
opinion now swung against Russia and in support of the Ottomans. Disraeli was prepared to go to war to
defend the Ottomans (and therefore the route to India), and mobilised the Indian Army and sent HMS
Devastation to the Dardanelles. Music hall audiences bellowed out: ‘We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo if
we do, we’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too!’ and the word ‘jingoism’ was
born.

~ 163 ~

Otto von Bismarck convened the
Congress of Berlin in 1878 to
diffuse the crisis without conflict:
Russia withdrew its initial plans
and Ottoman integrity was
preserved. Britain also collected
Cyprus as a new colonial
possession to ensure its
dominance in the eastern
Mediterranean.
Disraeli
proclaimed ‘peace in our time’
and
his
aggressive,
Palmerstonian stance, was wildly
popular.
However, between 1878 and 1880 Gladstone would launch his Midlothian campaign which criticised the
aggressive imperialism of ‘Beaconsfieldism’, especially in the aftermath of the Zulu War and the 2nd AngloAfghan War. Public opinion again swung behind his humanitarian ideals and Disraeli lost the 1880 election.

The missionaries bore a special responsibility for the increasing ‘cultural arrogance’ of the British
public and misrepresenting African society in a way calculated to give rise also to racial arrogance. The
reasons are not difficult to discern. The missionaries were entirely dependent on public support and
subscriptions to carry on their work. Missionaries were urged to send home detailed reports of their
activities and of the conditions they found. These reports were then given a very wide circulation. To
gain public sympathy, missionaries were inevitably tempted to stress the earthly as well as the spiritual
aspects of their work and to represent the life of the unconverted African as brutal and barbarous.
Some resorted to a kind of ‘before and after’ picture, representing the converted African as in a much
happier condition. This form of propaganda did at least portray the African as capable of
improvement, but it also, of necessity, belittled his indigenous culture. African religion was often illserved by missionary observation.
•

•

Adapted from M E Chamberlain, The Scramble for Africa, 2010

What does Chamberlain argue about the impact of missionaries on popular opinions in
Britain?

It was the Indian Mutiny that helped to generate the atmosphere of hero-worship so characteristic of
late nineteenth century imperialism. The military leaders of its suppression, figures such as Sir Henry
Havelock, became evangelical knights, defenders of the faith as well as of the Empire. Religion,
heroism, and empire were joined in a potent mix. Nineteenth-century heroes, most notably
Livingstone and General Gordon, were essentially religious figures, portrayed as moral giants facing
dark forces which martyred them in a Christ-like sacrifice. The churches and missionary societies were
important sources of the popular culture of empire. The myths of the Mutiny fed into the visual,
theatrical, and fictional representations of imperial action in the later part of the century.

The British public schools became seen as the institutions that bred the rulers of the empire. The ethos
within these schools (an emphasis on sport, teamwork, ‘muscular Christianity’, discipline, self-sacrifice
and the moulding of character, the prefect system, and a study of the Classical world) was seen as the
most appropriate training for the demands of imperial governance.

Vitaї Lampada by Sir Henry Newbolt (1892)
There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—
Ten to make and the match to win—
A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
An hour to play and the last man in.
And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,
Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote
'Play up! play up! and play the game! '
The sand of the desert is sodden red,—
Red with the wreck of a square that broke; —
The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel dead,
And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.
The river of death has brimmed his banks,
And England's far, and Honour a name,
But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:
'Play up! play up! and play the game! '

Developing concepts of race
Read:
•

pp. 364-367 in David Cannadine Victorious Century

Concepts of race and racism are extremely important to consider when studying British attitudes
towards non-European people in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, they were concepts that
developed and adapted over the course of this period, and they were shaped by the events and
intellectual currents of the time.

Empire depended on a belief in superiority. The most powerful notions were cultural, civilizational and
racial. The superiority of the British, and this their right to rule others, was established by their
allegedly ‘higher capacities’. In future times, under proper tutelage, non-Europeans might match or
emulate their achievements. The justification of empire was to create such conditions: it was
essentially an educational or civilising enterprise. This belief was widely voiced around 1900. The turn
of the century was also the apex of the belief that differences in culture or technological achievement
reflected biological ones; ‘scientific racism’. Closely linked to the role of racial beliefs in imperial
ideology was that of violence, repression and atrocity; the seemingly standard assumption that quite
different rules applied when fighting ‘savages’ than in warfare between European powers. The idea of
colonialism as a modernising force also accords with the self-image of the empire builders.
-

Stephen Howe, Empire and Ideology (2008)

British racial attitudes were not all arrogance and condescension. Even in the glaring noon of empire,
much generosity and respect still gave nobility to the Pax Britannica. The higher motives of the
imperialists were not all humbug. The Colonial Office in London consistently stood for fair play towards
the subject races, often against bitter criticism from white men on the spot. There were countless acts
of individual kindness. It was not viciousness, nor even conceit, that fostered the general aloofness of
the British. It was partly a sense of ordained separateness, partly the natural reserve if islanders and
partly, no doubt, the awkwardness people feel when they do not understand a foreigner, or more
especially do not speak the language. Many a British official learnt to love his charges with a passionate
sincerity. Even Alfred Milner, writing from Cairo in 1893, regarded the Sudanese with half -amused,
half-admiring and inoffensively patronising affection.

Historiography: Orientalism
In 1978 the Palestinian-American literary critic, Edward Said,
published a hugely influential work entitled Orientalism. He
further developed his ideas in Culture and Imperialism (1993).
Said essentially mounted a critique of Western conceptions of
the non-Western world. He argued that, over the last two
centuries, Western culture and attitudes had consistently
portrayed the non-Western (Oriental) world in a negative, nonflattering way, for which he coined the term ‘orientalism’. In
Said’s view, orientalism had become a dominant discourse
within Western societies; a common set of assumptions that
became widely accepted and internalised as a result of
repetition, and that this was embedded within the language and
culture of the West. In Said’s view, ‘the Orient’ was an idea
created by Europeans and defined by how it differed from the
‘civilised’ or ‘rational’ West; indigenous people and societies in
the rest of the (largely colonised) world were seen as ‘backward’,
‘exotic’, ‘irrational’ or ‘uncivilised’ and these stereotypes dehumanised colonial or non-western
peoples and justified (to Westerners) exploitation and empire. Western knowledge of non-Western
societies and cultures seen as a reflection of this ‘orientalist’ discourse rather than as an objective
truth.
Said’s work has been extremely influential and has encouraged Western academics and writers to re evaluate their attitudes to non-Western culture, and to consider the ideological bases of global
inequality and the legacies of imperialism, both in Western countries, and in the developing world.
Nevertheless, Said’s ideas have also been subjected to vigorous criticism and debate.

In Said’s notorious description, a coterie of Western intellectuals was able to disparage the intellectual
and cultural life of every part of the world beyond Europe as stagnant at best, retrogressive at worst;
and the societies that sustained it as variously corrupt, despotic, cruel and effeminate – when not
actually barbaric. European colonial regimes – the British foremost amongst them – he saw as zealous
enforcers of this self-serving doctrine. By the relentless condemnation of indigenous cultures and the
systematic promotion of forms of ‘colonial knowledge’ that favoured their power, they destroyed the
cultural self-confidence of those they ruled over. The application of Western science and technology,
the imposition of Western geopolitical forms (the territorial state), the dissemination of Western
literary forms (especially the novel), even the writing of history itself, added up to the claim that there
was only one escape from tradition (and backwardness) and only one form of modernity: the one
purveyed by colonial rule.
As might be expected, this sweeping analysis proved hugely attractive, and has continued to be so
despite a robust critical onslaught. It chimed with the widespread belief that the persistence of racism
in the post-colonial world sprang from the ‘deep’ mental structures that had sustained colonialism in
its prime and which remained as its legacy. It affirmed the conviction that Western modernity and
European empires (of which the British was the biggest) had been brothers-in-arms. As a challenge to

~ 170 ~

previous complacency or indifference, the ‘orientalism’ formula has been a powerful addition. But, as
is often the case, by exposing its assumptions, we can edge a bit closer to the more complex reality
that it is in danger of masking.
There are three obvious ways in which orientalism falls short as a convincing description of the cultural
impact of British expansion. Firstly, it ignores the importance of time and change, as if a single attitude
and a uniform approach prevailed over the whole period up to 1914 and beyond. In fact, British
thinking about non-Western peoples and cultures passed through a series of changes in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, amounting at times to the dramatic reversal of previous
orthodoxy. Secondly (a point that has often been made), Said’s thesis is almost quaintly monolithic. It
assumes that British opinion towards the non-Western world was all of a piece; that no major debates
upset the smooth ideological mould; that cultural practice was invariably draconian; and that those
who formed opinion and governed the discourse were the willing allies and agents of the imperial
state – as intellectuals were to be later in the Nazi and Stalinist states. Thirdly (and worst), it treats the
‘victims’ of this ‘cultural imperialism’ as precisely that: hapless and helpless. The rich and fascinating
record of non-Western responses to Western ideas – exploiting, adapting, embracing, rejecting,
revising, recycling – disappears into a crude caricature in which only two reactions were possible –
resistance of compliance – and only one permitted.
The actual picture was much more confused and complicated. This is not just an obvious and tedious
truism, but it goes to the heart of the cultural impact of empire. For its most striking feature was the
strength of mutual ambivalence. Of course, in any colonial setting there were those who celebrated
imperial power, the colonising ‘mission’ and its supposed triumphs of ‘progress’. But there were
always those who were doubtful, dismissive, uneasy or critical – both on the spot and at home. Their
influence was intermittently but sometimes critically powerful. Among the colonised there were many
who resented – deeply, bitterly and uncompromisingly – the alien cultural intrusion for a number of
reasons, not all altruistic. But there were also many who looked towards it for group opportunity,
spiritual promise and personal liberation. They sought to propitiate, serve, manage and exploit it for
purposes to which their foreign political masters were often quite blind. There were even those
orphans of history whose security, identity and even ethnicity came to be bound up with it.

Lord Salisbury and Tory ‘High’ Imperialism
Lord Salisbury presided over the British Empire when it was
at its zenith. Although he was a reactionary grandee who
was deeply suspicious of democracy, he was remarkably
successful at it. He was Prime Minister on three occasions
(1885-86; 1886-92; 1895-1902) during a period of
Conservative dominance after the Liberal split over Irish
Home Rule. His principal interest was foreign affairs and he
appointed himself Foreign Secretary. For his final term in
office he appointed the Liberal Unionist Joseph
Chamberlain as Colonial Secretary.
Although he was personally rather sceptical of the value of
increasing Britain’s colonial possessions, his government
presided over several key imperial events as was generally
associated, in the public mind at least, with a ‘forward’
imperial policy:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Consolidation of Britain’s possessions in Africa – agreements on borders with other powers in
1890
Hostility to Irish Home Rule
Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, 1897
Sudan campaign and the Fashoda incident, 1898
Consolidation of Britain’s position in the Far East – acquisition of Wei-hei-wei (1898)
The Boer War, 1899-1902

Salisbury was not above exploiting imperial matters for domestic political gain; in 1900 he called and
won the ‘khaki’ election after a series of British victories in the Boer War.
Salisbury’s foreign policy is generally associated with the concept of ‘splendid isolation’ whereby
Britain avoided firm European alliances and entanglements and, instead, relied on the power of its
navy to defend its international position. The increasing power of Germany and the humiliations of
the Boer War led many in Britain to re-evaluate this doctrine after Salisbury resigned in 1902.
‘High’ or ‘Forward’ Imperialists: This Conservative-dominated period saw the dominance of several
individuals who were almost fanatically in favour of the British Empire. They believed the empire was
‘the greatest force for good the world has ever seen’ (Curzon). However, whether these individuals
were the main shapers of British policy, or ever enjoyed popular support, is a very different matter:

Growing Anxiety, 1890 -1914
In 1871 a best-selling book The Battle for Dorking by Sir George Chesney described
a Prussian invasion of England and the occupation of London. This was
symptomatic of a growing anxiety about the future amongst some politicians and
opinion-shapers in Britain in the later 19th century. Although the British Empire
had grown at an astonishing rate and, superficially, seemed incredibly strong, this
period saw a period of introspection and a growing sense that Britain had less and
less reason to feel confident about the future. Other, younger, more dynamic
countries were believed to be snapping at Britain’s heels and its future hegemony
was increasingly called into question.
There were several strands to this growing sense of anxiety:

Economic
Decline?

Public
Apathy/
Hostility to
Empire?

Military
Weakness?

Growing
Anxiety

Nationalist
Pressures?

Strategic
Isolation?

Britain’s changing economic position, 1880 -1914
Read:
➢ Chapter 9 in AQA text
In statistical terms, the economic trends for Britain did not look encouraging:
•

•

Britain’s share of world trade:
•

1880: 23%

•

1910: 17%

Share of global industrial capacity in 1910:
•

Britain: 15%

•

Germany: 16%

•

USA: 35%

Britain was clearly slipping from its mid-19th century position as the dominant manufacturing and
trading power. Other countries were fast industrialising and seemed to have more potential for fast
economic growth.

~ 177 ~

Changing contexts:
The international trading environment that had favoured Britain in the middle years of the nineteenth
century was profoundly altered in the later years of the century by the growing political power of
Britain’s two traditional rivals, France and Russia. Britain also faced two new challengers, the United
States and Germany. Moreover, rapid industrialisation had made the American and German
economies increasingly fierce competitors in the markets that British manufacturers had comfortably
claimed as their own. Even little Belgium had established a steel industry that challenged that of
Birmingham. It was agriculture, however, that was the first to feel the full brunt of competition. The
global spread of cheap and reliable railway and shipping systems allowed North American grain,
Argentine beef, New Zealand butter, and various other agricultural goods to flood the British market,
causing prices to plummet. The trade slump that began in 1873 seemed to many Britons a taste of
things to come.
-

Dane Kennedy, Britain and Empire 1880-1945, 2002

❖ What does Kennedy argue about Britain’s economic position in the later 19th century?

Several developments led many in Britain to re-evaluate Britain’s commitment to free trade and,
therefore, the importance of empire to Britain’s prosperity:
•
•
•

•

The impact of the Great Depression (c. 1873 – c. 1896) ➔ this led to protectionism from some
powers (e.g. Germany)
The growing industrial might of other powers such as Germany, Japan and the United States
mean that Britain’s share of global manufacturing production was in relative decline.
The growing colonialism associated with the Scramble for Africa and the new colonial
acquisitions in the Far East meant that it was harder to enforce free trade through an ‘informal
empire’. As Britain’s influence in an informal empire lessened, it relied increasingly on its
colonial possessions.
The costs of empire increased as the international situation altered: although India paid for its
own defence, the maintenance of the British fleet was increasingly expensive and many
colonies did not cover their costs.

~ 178 ~

Was it all bad news?
The later years of the nineteenth century witnessed the relative decline of the British economy, caused
by the slow growth of manufacturing output. Manufactured exports grew much more slowly after
1870 than before and Britain’s share of world visible trade fell. Invisibles, on the other hand, increased
rapidly until 1914 with profits being made from the growing service sector, led by the global extension
of the sterling standard and credit from the City of London. The influence of industry on central
government and on economic policy continued to be limited by its relative lack of access to the major
sources of power and influence. Manufacturers were still largely outside the circle of gentlemanly
culture and did not ‘speak the same language’ as the aristocratic elite
•

•

PJ Cain and AG Hopkins, Gentlemanly Capitalism and British Expansion Overseas: New
Imperialism, 1850-1945, 1987

What do Cain and Hopkins argue about the British economy in the later 19th Century?

Even as Britain had to compete increasingly with other manufacturing economies, it remained the preeminent power in terms of financial services (‘invisibles’) and capital investment. Huge earnings from
services such as insurance and banking offset any imbalance in imports/ exports in goods. The City of
London remained the world’s financial capital and, as Cain and Hopkins have argued, the importance
of these aspects of the economy grew as the 19th century drew to a close. British overseas investment
doubled between 1900 and 1913 from £2 billion to £4 billion, but an increasing share of this was with
non-imperial countries. For instance, an enormous share of British capital flowed to the USA and Latin
America.
Colonial markets still provided safe returns on investment. The Colonial Loans and Colonial Stocks Acts
of 1899 and 1900 facilitated a number of infrastructure projects such as rail links in Africa. Yet, there
was often a disincentive to invest in some colonial projects. For example, investment in Indian textile
manufacturing would compete with the British textile industry and so was not encouraged.

~ 179 ~

Should free trade be abandoned?
As the 19th Century drew to a close, Britain remained committed to the
principles of free trade that it had pursued since the 1840s. Most British
people regarded free trade as the source of their prosperity and power.
Consequently, it had always been assumed that direct control of colonial
territories and markets were not essential; although British trade with its
colonies was significant, of greater and growing importance was Britain’s
trade with non-colonial markets in Europe, the USA and other parts of the
world. In the 1890s Britain did more trade with Belgium than with the whole
of Africa.

The mere fact that Britain ruled a particular market as a colony did not necessarily mean that she only
traded with it because it was a colony. The ideological free traders in the first half of the nineteenth
century argued that she might have done even more business with the country if it had not been. They
offered the example of the United States – with whom Britain’s trade actually rose after the War of
Independence [1775-1783] – to prove their case.

What was the concept of ‘Greater Britain’?
Concerns about Britain’s relative decline led to a search for solutions. For
some the empire was seen to be the key that could safeguard the future.
This was outlined most eloquently by JR Seeley, Regius Professor of History
at the University of Cambridge who published his account of Britain’s
empire in 1883, The Expansion of England:

"We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind".
“A separation (from the settler colonies) would leave England on the same level as the states nearest
to us on the Continent, populous, but less so than Germany and scarcely equal to France. But two
states, Russia and the United States, would be on an altogether higher scale of magnitude, Russia
having at once, and the United States perhaps before very long, twice our population".
"The other alternative is that England may prove able to do what the United States does so easily, that
is, hold together in a federal union countries very remote from each other. In that case England w ill
take rank with Russia and the United States in the first rank of state, measured by population and area,
and in a higher rank that the states of the Continent".
"It may be fairly questioned whether the possession of India does or ever can increase our power or
our security, while there is no doubt that is vastly increases our dangers and responsibilities… When
we inquire then into the Greater Britain of the future we ought to think much more of our colonial than
of our Indian Empire".

‘Greater Britain’ - The British ‘Dominions’
Read:
•
•

pp. 307-318 in James
For more detail: chapter 18 in Norman Lowe Mastering Modern British History

Migration from Britain to the settler colonies continued throughout the 19 th Century. This accelerated
during periods of recession and many migrated from Ireland to escape the poverty there. 1.8 million
emigrated from Britain between 1900 and 1910, half of these to the settler colonies. By 1900 20% of
the white population of the empire were living in the settler colonies.
To avoid the sort of resentment that had prompted the American Revolution in 1776, and for reasons
for cost, these colonies became self-governing as soon as this was practicable. They could raise their
own taxes, were responsible for their territorial security, and could make their own laws. London
remained responsible for foreign policy, constitutional matters, and defence. Rather than ‘co lonies’,
by the 20th Century, they became known as dominions:
•
•
•
•
•

Canada – federated in 1867
Newfoundland – self-governing from 1854
Australia – federated in 1901 (although individual colonies/ states self-governing long before
then)
New Zealand self-governing from 1856
South Africa – creation of federal Union in 1910 (although component parts had been selfgoverning long before then)

Native policy in these different colonies would vary. In Australia, the aboriginal people were regarded
as having forfeited any rights of the land and were treated brutally; in Tasmania, for example, all native
people had died out or been killed by 1869. In New Zealand, the Maori were a more assertive force
and fought a series of wars against the settlers over land rights. Maoris were given the right to vote
alongside the settlers. In South Africa, to avoid alienating the Boers, black Africans and mixed -race
people were denied the franchise in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. In Canada, there was a
rebellion in 1885 by native people which was quickly crushed.
The relationship with Britain was retained, despite self-government and a growing awareness that
the dominions were developing their own ‘national’ identities. (One feature was that settler societies
tended to be much more egalitarian than hierarchical and class-bound Britain). The monarch remained
head of state, there were ties of kinship, and there was an obvious continuation of cultural links
through the English language and sport. Moreover, as international relations darkened towards the
late 19th Century, the dominions reinforced their military attachment to Britain. The Royal Navy
remained responsible for the overall defence of Australia and New Zealand and financial contributions
were sent to the Admiralty in London. Furthermore, the dominions sent troops to aid Britain in the
Sudan campaign of 1885 and the Boer War (where some 30,000 joined the British forces). Although
attempts to institutionalise the relationship through Imperial Federation came to nought, it was
evident that the dominions would significantly bolter British power in the 20 th Century.

~ 184 ~

Australia and the other dominions were becoming increasingly aware of the political and strategic
value of the imperial connection. So too was Britain which, since the mid-1870s, was endeavouring to
survive in a mutable and none too friendly world. As she entered into competition with hostile powers
whose strength matched her own, it became imperative for Britain to cultivate colonial goodwill. The
colonies were becoming valuable assets, since their assistance might prove vital in the event of conflict
with France and Russia. Shifts in the global balance of power generated anxieties within the
dominions, which had for the first time to come to terms with their own isolation and vulnerability.
The possibility of an Anglo-Russian war in 1877-8, and with it seaborne raids by Russian warships on
the Pacific coastlines of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, made the governments of each
appreciate the extent of their dependence upon the Royal Navy.

The dream of ‘Imperial Federation’ dies:
Imperial Federation was seen by some as a solution to Irish Home
Rule, as well as the fear that the empire could disintegrate as more
colonies became self-governing. The creation of an Imperial
Federation was seen as necessary to preserve British power in the face
of the rising fortunes of the USA, Germany and Russia.
The Imperial Federation League was founded in 1884 to pressure for
this policy, and it established branches in Canada and Australia. The
idea of federation was supported by many Conservative and Liberal
politicians, as well as individuals such as Alfred Milner and Cecil
Rhodes.
Joseph Chamberlain became the most prominent proponent with his
tariff reform scheme for ‘imperial preference’ and split the
Conservative Party with his proposal to abandon free trade. The general election of 1906 saw a Liberal
landslide which indicated widespread popular hostility towards imperial preference.
The closest to reality that Imperial Federation came was in a series of Colonial Conferences held in
London between senior figures from each self-governing colony: 1887, 1894, 1897 and 1902. At the
latter two, Joseph Chamberlain’s imperial preference policy was discussed, but decisions were nonbinding and nothing came of the plan. Indeed, the Imperial Federation League was wound up in 1894
due to lack of public support.
By the end of the First World War, the self-governing dominions sought to be treated as equal and
independent states and the hopes for Imperial Federation were at an end. In the 1930s, schemes for
imperial preference were revisited in the context of the Great Depression, but these were discussions
between independent members of the Commonwealth and there was no appetite for formal political
integration.

Despite the ever-greater polarisation of international politics between 1902 and 1904, there was no
reordering of the Empire. The wish of the settler colonies to preserve control of their own affairs, the
attractions of free trade to the British electorate in 1906 and the weight of the United Kingdom’s nonimperial interests, were sufficient to defeat the imperial consolidationists’ onslaught. This was
perhaps just as well. Attempts at a stronger subordination of the tropical colonies to British needs
might have overwhelmed more constructive approaches to their administration. The evidence of local
political mobilisation in India and Egypt after 1900 suggests that it would also have provoked serious
indigenous protest. Centralisation at the expense of the Dominions before 1914 could have
jeopardised those compromises which subsequently enabled cooperation to continue and the
Dominions to make vital contributions to Imperial defence and welfare during the First World War.

An alternative solution? ‘National Efficiency’
Read:
•

pp. 102-103 in AQA text

The Boer War and the rising German threat also provoked a debate about the state of British society.
If the military had made such a meal of a few farmers toting rifles, how could Britain expect to match
a real European adversary equipped with modern artillery? There were also severe doubts as to
whether the population was fit for a long struggle: the poor physical condition of many urban recruits
suggested that the national stock had ‘degenerated’. These sentiments gave rise to the ‘national
efficiency’ movement, designed to make Britain a more productive, rational, and this more powerful
society. In February 1902, the National Service League was set up to agitate for the introduction of
conscription, thus ‘distributing the burdens of national defence equally among all classes, instead of
allowing them to weigh crushingly upon the proletariat.’

Brendan Simms, Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy (2014)

The performance of the British economy, the difficulties of the Boer War, and the rising strategic
challenge posed by other powers (especially Germany) led to much soul-searching within Britain. Poor
diet, poor health, and poor living conditions were exposed by the difficulties of recruitment during the
war. Britain, it was believed, was both literally and metaphorically unfit to face the challenges of the
20th Century. This led to calls from all corners of public life for a focus on ‘national efficiency’ to
prevent the country’s decline. A series of specific actions followed:

The Liberals and the Empire
Read:
➢ pp. 172-176 in Porter
Gladstone had regarded himself as a ‘reluctant imperialist’ and
the Liberal Party were generally sceptical of the New Imperialism
associated with the Conservative Party. Nevertheless, they were
not an anti-Imperialist party and several key Liberals (including
Lord Rosebery, Prime Minister, 1894-95) were enthusiastic
supporters of Britain’s imperial mission. By contrast, several
Liberal critics (including David Lloyd George) had been portrayed
as pro-Boers by the Conservatives due to their criticisms of the
Boer War.
In 1906, the Liberal Party won the general election, in large part
due to their criticisms of Conservative imperial policy: the
conduct of the Boer War and the scandal that engulfed Milner
over ‘Chinese slavery’ in South Africa; also the contentious issue
of Imperial Preference which was seen by many members of the electorate to threaten the price of
food.
Herbert Asquith led the Liberals as Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916, with David Lloyd George as his
Chancellor. The Liberal government, despite accusations from their opponents, were not in any way
opposed to empire. Rather they wanted to pursue imperialism in a very different way. Together, they
introduced a series of reforms to address the deficiencies revealed in the Boer War, counter the
growing international threat, and develop the empire in a different direction from that pursued by the
Tory ‘forward’ imperialists:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Promotion of free trade and an ending of ideas of imperial federation/ imperial preference
Avoidance of the use of force to achieve security
Measures to address the problems of ‘national efficiency’
Development of the Royal Navy
End of ‘splendid isolation’ → alliances with Japan, France and Russia
Minto-Morley reforms in India
Irish Home Rule

❖ In what ways did the Liberal Government’s imperial policies differ from those of the
preceding Conservative Government?

~ 192 ~

The later nineteenth century witnessed the elevation of the monarchy into an institution endowed
with patriotic and imperial symbolism, enjoying a world-wide significance. With the great climax of
the Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Queen Victoria came to almost represent an ‘Imperial Britannia’ herself.
An imperial ideology; a powerful mixture of patriotism, excitement about adventure and colonial
warfare; reverence for the monarchy; the application of British cultural values to other peoples;
admiration for military virtues and an almost religious approach to the obligations of world -wide
power came to dominate many aspects of popular culture. Throughout society, sporadic ex citement
about imperial affairs turned patriotism into jingoism, attitudes to other peoples often shaded into
outright racism and imperial self-righteousness was capable of being transformed into extreme
bellicosity.

‘Heart of Darkness’ – the Congo Free State
There are several examples of appalling
atrocities committed in Africa by Europeans
that pricked the conscience of the public back
in Europe. These events helped create a
humanitarian argument against imperialism.
The Congo had been awarded to King Leopold
II of the Belgians at the Congress of Berlin; he
convinced the other nations that he was
supportive of humanitarian work there. He
ruled the Congo as a vast personal estate and it
was not overseen by the Belgian government.
In fact, the Congo became a grotesque example
of predatory capitalism; the native population
were reduced to the status of slaves and
exploited with no concern for their welfare.
The aim was simply to generate profits for
Leopold and his companies. Rubber, in
particular, was the principal export from 1891
after the invention of the pneumatic tyre
created large demand in Europe. Leopold
instructed his Force Publique (his own private
army) to enforce the collection of rubber quotas. If labourers did not collect the required 8 kilos of sap
in a fortnight, their hands and feet were cut off. The appalling treatment, the spread of disease, and
the lack of food led to very high death rates. The following native song expressed the misery of the
exploited:
We are tired of living under this tyranny,
We cannot endure that our women and children are taken away
And dealt with by white savages.
We shall make war…
We know that we shall die, but we want to die.
Numbers are difficult to pin down but estimates of those killed range from
1 million to 10 million.
The author Joseph Conrad published the novel Heart of Darkness in 1899
which exposed the horrors of Leopold’s regime. In the novel, Kurtz, a station
manager deep in the jungle, has been driven insane by the isolation and
brutality. When Marlow, the narrator, finds him, he discovers a pamphlet
that Kurtz has written on the native population. It simply ends, ‘exterminate
the brutes.’

~ 194 ~

The treatment of the Congolese led to an outcry, particularly in Britain, where the humanitarian lobby
campaigned against Leopold’s rule. The British Congo Reform Association was founded in 1904 and
led by Edmund Morel (left), an eyewitness to the crimes who had served as a clerk on a shipping line.
Another key campaigner was Sir Roger Casement (later an Irish nationalist) who served as British
consul to the Congo from 1901.
As international criticism grew, Leopold was eventually pressured into handing over the Congo to the
direct administration of the Belgian government who instituted a more humane regime. In total, it is
estimated that Leopold had made 47.5 million francs from the Congo. He never expressed any
remorse.

Rudyard Kipling – ‘The White Man’s Burden’ (1898)
Take up the White Man's burden-Send forth the best ye breed-Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild-Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.
Take up the White Man's burden-The savage wars of peace-Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.
Take up the White Man's burden-And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard-The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:-"Why brought he us from bondage,
Our loved Egyptian night?"

the Empire?

Henry Labouchere – The Brown Man’s Burden (1899)
Pile on the brown man's burden
To gratify your greed;
Go, clear away the natives
Who progress would impede;
Be very stern, for truly
'Tis useless to be mild
With new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child.
Pile on the brown man's burden;
And, if ye rouse his hate,
Meet his old-fashioned reasons
With Maxims up to date.
With shells and dumdum bullets
A hundred times made plain
The brown man's loss must ever
Imply the white man's gain.
Pile on the brown man's burden,
And if his cry be sore,
That surely need not irk you-Ye've driven slaves before.
Seize on his ports and pastures,
The fields his people tread;
Go make from them your living,
And mark them with his dead.

This poem was written as a parody of Kipling’s poem by Liberal
politician Henry Labouchere in 1899.

type that Kipling expresses in his poem?

Strategic Threats
Read:
➢ pp. 334-349 in James
By the end of 1903… the German threat had replaced the Russian menace as the principal concern for
British foreign policy. This had profound implications for maritime strategy and imperial governance.
Over the past two decades, Britain had assumed that her global status depended on the empire. ‘As
long as we rule India,’ Lord Curzon, the viceroy, had remarked in January 1901, ‘we are the greatest
power in the world. If we lose it we shall drop straightaway to a 3 rd rate power’. Now a large army
capable of intervening on the continent would be needed, and the Army Reform Bill of 1901 was a
first step in this direction. The creation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a body which despite
its name was firmly focused on the military situation in Europe, followed in 1902. That same year saw
the establishment of the new ‘Home Fleet’ in response to the German naval challenge and which soon
absorbed most of the Admiralty’s attention and resources. If Britain was going to do les s on the global
stage, however, then the empire would have to do more. The white settler colonies were already
coming to this conclusion themselves. Australia and New Zealand observed German advances in the
Pacific, and especially the Japanese victory over China in 1895, with concern. The New South Wales
statesman Sir Henry Parks therefore stepped up the negotiations for federation begun in 1889. In
1900, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia finally came together to
form a federation. This reflected not the rise of separatist nationalism, but the opposite: a
determination to keep the British connection as security provider of last resort, and a realisation that
the burden of imperial defence would have to be shared more equally. Britain was to remain the global
sheriff, but Australia would serve as her deputy in the South Pacific.

In the years before the First World War, British thinking about the Empire was overwhelmingly
pessimistic. Periodicals and journals were surprisingly full of defeatist talk. The reason is not hard to
find. The South African War (1899–1902) cast a long and exceedingly sober shadow. The confidence
of the years leading up to this conflict and the mindless patriotism of Mafeking night on 17 May 1900
soon faded, in the aftermath of the most important and divisive imperial war since the loss of the
American colonies in the late eighteenth century. The war in South Africa destroyed the idea that the
Englishman was the born ruler of the world.
Adapted from R Hyam, The British Empire in the Edwardian Era,1999
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the British people, regardless of the political party
they supported, were committed to the Empire. Some may have argued against the expansion or
abuse of imperial power, but it was beyond the imagination of contemporary Britons to argue against
the continuation of the Empire itself. The new century had begun with a disturbing colonial war that
caused some anxiety and this brought about a critical examination of Britain and its place in the world.
What stands out in the various official and unofficial recommendations that followed is the emphasis
placed on the Empire as a remedy for the nation’s ills.
Adapted from D Kennedy, Britain and Empire 1880–1945, 2002

Rudyard Kipling – ‘Recessional’ (1897)
God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle line,
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
Dominion over palm and pine—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The Captains and the Kings depart:
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
Far-called our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the Law—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word—
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!
