The British Empire, 1857 - 1967
We live in a world that empires have made. Indeed, most of the modern world is the relic of empires:
colonial and pre-colonial, African, Asian, European and American. Its history and culture is riddled with
the memories, aspirations, institutions and grievances left behind by those empires. The largest if not
the grandest of these was the empire laboriously assembled by the British across more than three
centuries. No less than one quarter of today’s sovereign states were hewn from its fabric. For that
reason alone, its impact was second to none.

Guide to essay writing at A-Level:
The essay is the basic form of expressing yourself as an historian. An essay is, essentially, an argument
which argues a case in response to a specific question. It is not simply a factual account or a narrative
of events.
1. Read The Question Carefully:
Read the question carefully and identify the key terms. Be clear what the question is asking you and
note whether the question gives any dates that you need to focus on. The nature of the question can
help you decide your structure.
2. Reading:
Once you understand the question, you then need to go through the information that might help you
answer it. Look back through your notes carefully and pick out material that might be relevant. This
might also be the time to do some selective reading if there are any gaps in your notes or areas you
want to develop. As you read, always have the essay question in the back of your mind.
3. Planning:
Once you have all the material you need, you need to write a plan. Planning your essay is essential –
you need to know what you are going to say and how you are going to say it before you start writing
your final essay. This takes time and Sixth Formers are often reluctant to do it but it really helps to
ensure that your final essay is effective. If necessary, you may need to do a bit more reading at this
stage
4. Introduction:
Your introduction is one of the most important and complex parts of the essay. Your introduction
should not set the scene (you are not writing a novel) but should directly address the question and set
out what you are going to argue. You (and the reader) should know where the essay is going from the
outset; the reader should be able to work out the essence of your argument simply by reading the
introduction. In summary, an introduction needs to do the following things:
-

Define the terms of the question and deal with any ambiguous terms/ concepts etc. – don’t
let the question push you around!
Outline what the debate in the question is.
Outline what you are going to argue in your essay.
5. Structure:

There is a range of ways of structuring an essay. However, there are two common approached that
you can often use at A-Level, depending on what the question is:
‘Factors’ Essay – this is often used in answering causation or consequence questions. The question will
state a factor and ask you to consider how important it was. For example, the question could ask
whether X was the most important cause of Y. You would need to consider the importance of X (the

~8~

stated factor) in your first paragraph, followed by a range of other factors in other paragraphs. (If you
don’t think X is the most important factor, your second paragraph should explain what is):
-

Introduction
First Paragraph – explain the importance of the stated factor
Second Paragraph – explain the most important factor (if not X)
Further Paragraphs – explain the importance of other factors
Conclusion

‘Two Sides’ Essay – this is slightly more straightforward and can be used if the question asks you to
assess the successes/ failures of something, or for other questions that simply offer a binary yes/ no
answer:
-

Introduction
First few Paragraphs – deal with the points supporting one side of the argument
Final few Paragraphs – deal with the points supporting the other side of the argument
Conclusion
6. Paragraphs:

A paragraph should mark a stage in your argument and should itself be structured carefully. The most
effective paragraphs have the following straightforward structure:
-

Point – the first sentence (sometimes called a ‘topic sentence’) makes the point that the
paragraph is making.
Evidence – the next few sentences give detailed factual evidence to support the point the
paragraph is making.
Analysis – link the paragraph (the point) back to the overall question and explain the
significance of the point you have made.

When planning your essay, it is often a good idea to write down the first sentence of each paragraph
so that you have an outline – you can then develop each one later.
7. Conclusion:
This needs to sum up your overall argument and explain, in summary, how the different threads of
your essay fit together. The conclusion needs to be consistent with your introduction and everything
else that has gone before. At the top end, conclusions also help put the question into a wider context
and hint at other questions that have been raised. Conclusions are difficult to write and you will
improve as you move through the Sixth Form. Ensure, though, that you leave plenty of time to write
your conclusion and don’t rush it.
8. Proof Reading:
Once you have written your essay, proof read it to ensure that it makes sense and that the spelling,
grammar and punctuation are accurate. If necessary, ask someone else to help you.

~9~

Style Guide:
Clarity
This is the most important aspect of any piece of writing. If it is not clear what point you are making,
the essay or paragraph needs rewriting. Reread sections that you have completed. If you are unsure
what they mean, somebody else will be too. Ask other people to read sections and get them to explain
back to you what they think you are trying to say. If they are unsure, you need to make some changes.
Precision
You need to ensure that you sound as though you know what you are talking about. To do this, you
need to be precise in the points you make. For example, rather than saying ‘British rule expanded in
Africa over many years’, be precise about the dates of his reign. Give dates, names and specific
examples as much as you can.
Concision
Try to make your point in as few words as possible. Avoid tautology (‘the ice was completely frozen’)
and don’t try to ‘pad’ sentences out with superfluous words. In addition, don’t try to sound clever by
using long words when a perfectly good short one would do as this will affect the clarity of your
writing.
Formality
Ensure that you always use formal English in your essay. Avoid slang and colloquialisms and also avoid
hackneyed phrases (‘The British bit off more than he could chew’). Certainly avoid gratuitous abuse
(‘Cecil Rhodes was a complete idiot’) as this will detract from any serious analysis. In addition, avoid
using contractions (‘could have’ rather than ‘could’ve’). Avoid using acronyms that aren’t in common
currency (e.g. don’t use ‘S.F.A.’ in place of the Scramble for Africa).
Avoid use of the first person
The first person makes the essay sound less formal and you can still express your own view without
using it. For example: ‘William Gladstone was largely motivated by moral concerns’ is a clear
expression of your view and there is no need to rephrase it as ‘I believe that William Gladstone was
largely motivated by moral concerns.’ The former is obviously your opinion as you are the one writing
the essay and making the argument!
Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation
Ensure that you check spelling, grammar and punctuation carefully. Don’t just rely on spell check as
this frequently gets things wrong (particularly when dealing with foreign names or words). In addition,
check that you have capitalised all proper nouns. It is well worth asking a tolerant friend or parent to
read your essay through to check it for any errors.

~ 10 ~

When to use quotations from historians in an essay:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Don’t just chuck them in for no reason or to pad out your paragraph. They need to serve a
particular purpose.
Avoid including quotations that just refer to factual information (unless it is particularly
obscure and only that historian mentions it).
Instead, you should look for the historians’ opinions and arguments, whether they agree with
your perspective or not.
You can also include quotations when they put a point in a particularly pithy and memorable
way.
Try to keep quotations as short as you can
Integrate quotations into the flow of your own writing – they should sound as if they naturally
fit into your paragraph
Think about whether a paraphrase of the historians’ view would work better than a quotation
Always reference a historian’s view whether it is a quotation or a paraphrase to avoid
plagiarism

~ 11 ~

Guide to answering interpretations questions:
The phrasing of the question will always be:
‘Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments in these
extracts are in relation to…[issue/ theme linked to a key question of the specification]’
•
•
•

There will always be a range of interpretations.
They will collectively cover a theme/ issue spanning a 20-30 year period (individual extracts
may be more focused).
Engage with each interpretation in turn – essentially three separate exercises.

Structure of answer/ analysis of each interpretation:
1. Comprehension:
• Identify in summary the overall argument – one point
• Points to identify the supporting points/ arguments that show how the author comes to
their interpretation (you may incorporate these later as you seek to support or challenge
the arguments)
o
o
o

‘The main argument of X is…’
‘X supports this claim by arguing…’
‘In addition, they argue…’

2. Challenge/ Corroboration using own knowledge:
❖ 5 points from your own knowledge that either corroborate or challenge the interpretation
(or parts of the interpretation) given in the extract
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o

‘X is most convincing in their claim that… because, from our contextual knowledge
it is clear that…’
‘X wisely argues/ is astute to identify that…’
‘X is correct to identify that…’
‘X is correct to mention’
‘X’s assertion that… is convincing because…’
‘However, what is less convincing about X’s argument is…’
‘X neglects to mention…’
‘X could emphasise more…’
‘X is incorrect to emphasise…’
‘X is incorrect to suggest…

3. Reach a judgement on the interpretation:
o

‘Therefore, X’s arguments are relatively (un)convincing, although their claim
that… is perhaps too emphatic/ not emphatic enough. Overall, this is the
most/least convincing argument of the three extracts.’

4. Repeat the process for the other two interpretations

Bibliography:
At Sixth Form, you are expected to be more independent in your studies. A large proportion of your
time should be spent reading around the subject to enhance and consolidate your knowledge. Indeed,
if you are aiming for an A or an A* it is essential that you read widely and don’t just rely on your basic
textbook or the information you get in lessons. Fortunately, there is a wealth of excellent historical
writing on the British Empire:
General academic surveys of the British Empire – asterisked books are ‘key texts’ - particularly
recommended or required reading and there are multiple copies within the department.
❖ *Bernard Porter The Lion’s Share (5th edn.) (Pearson; 2012)
o An excellent narrative of Britain’s imperial story from 1850 to the
present. Particularly good on explaining the international
economic and geopolitical context.

❖ *Lawrence James The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (Abacus; 1995)
o Covers the whole of the British Empire from c. 1600 – the latter
sections will be more useful for this course. A good narrative with
a focus on the domestic impact of empire in Britain, as well as
events overseas.

❖ Niall Ferguson Empire (Penguin; 2004)
o A controversial book that accompanied a TV series. His central
thesis is that British imperialism produced most of the concepts
and values that shape the modern world – a positive gloss on the
imperial story.

❖ Denis Judd Empire: The British Imperial Experience from 1765 to the
Present (IB Tauris; 2011)
o An engaging narrative of the empire from the eighteenth
century, taking as its structure a series of defining moments that
convey the essence of the imperial period.

~ 13 ~

❖ John Darwin The Empire Project (Cambridge; 2011)
o A detailed look at the main components of empire from the
1830s to decolonisation. A key feature of this book is the
importance it gives to the impact of Britain’s geopolitical
position.

❖ *John Darwin Unfinished Empire (Penguin; 2013)
o A superb look at British imperial history from a thematic
perspective. Darwin is excellent at identifying what is important
in such a vast and potentially confusing topic.

❖ Philippa Levine The British Empire (2nd edn.) (Routledge; 2013)
o A brief thematic look at key aspects of imperial history

❖ PJ Marshall Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire
o A good narrative overview followed by chapters covering various
important themes by different authors.

❖ The Oxford History of the British Empire (volumes III and IV), edited by
WM Roger Louis (Oxford; 2001)
o A collection of essays covering all aspects of the empire. Volume
III focuses on the 19th century, while volume IV focuses on the
20th century. They are an essential companion for serious
academic study of this topic.

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography is available online through the school
library and has accounts of the lives of all significant individuals covered in this course.

~ 14 ~

❖ Ashley Jackson The British Empire: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford; 2013)
o Part of the Very Short Introduction series – this does what it says on
the tin and gives a helpful orientation to the topic. Available online
through the school library website.

More specialised texts:
The study of the British Empire incorporates the study of a very large number of countries in the world
today. There are more specialist works available on India, or parts of Africa, as well as other regions.
The history department and library have a selection of resources – please do ask Mr Grant for further
details.
On wider context:
The following are useful if you want to broaden your knowledge of the period. If you are thinking of
applying to read History at university, you might benefit from looking at the following:
❖ David Cannadine Victorious Century (Penguin; 2018)
o An overview narrative of British history in the 19th Century
❖ Peter Clarke Hope and Glory (Penguin; 2004)
o An overview narrative of British history in the 20 Century
❖ John Darwin After Tamerlane (Penguin; 2008)
o A compelling account of the rise and fall of global empires since c. 1400 – an
excellent introduction to world history

Podcasts:
Podcasts are a fantastic way to give you an overview or a greater understanding of unfamiliar topics.
Some of the best are as follows:
The Rest is History: Historians Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook are
interrogating the past, attempting to de-tangle the present for their new
podcast "The Rest Is History". They question the nature of Greatness, why the West
no longer has civil wars and whether Richard Nixon was more like Caligula or
Claudius. They're distilling the entirety of human history, or, as much as they can fit
into about thirty minutes.

HistoryExtra podcast episodes are released every week, featuring interviews with
notable historians on topics spanning ancient history through to recent British to
American events. Episodes feature history stories and perspectives on everything
from crusading knights to Tudor monarchs and the D-Day landings.

Empire: How do empires rise? Why do they fall? And how have they shaped the
world around us today? William Dalrymple and Anita Anand explore the stories,
personalities and events of empire over the course of history. The first series looks
at the British in India, covering the East India Company, the Raj, Gandhi,
Independence and Partition.

In Our Time (Radio 4): The legendary broadcaster, Melvyn Bragg, chairs a regular
discussion about a matter of academic interest on Radio 4. The back catalogue is
available as podcasts online – many of them have a historical theme and some, such
as that on the Indian Mutiny, are directly relevant to our course.

The First World War
Read:

pp. 353-370 in James
pp. 119-121 in AQA

The War:
Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia + Italy (from 1915)) vs. Central Powers (Germany, AustriaHungary + Ottoman Empire)
British control of the seas remained strong – confirmed after the 1916 Battle of Jutland – blockade of
Germany. However, unrestricted submarine warfare hugely damaged Britain’s trade.
‘Western Front’ in Europe seen by many to be the main theatre of warfare BUT other theatres on
the imperial periphery:
•

In particular the British sought to exploit the ‘soft underbelly’ of the Central Powers, the
Ottoman Empire:
o Ottoman sultan/caliph declared jihad in an attempt to mobilise the British Empire’s
Islamic populations – limited impact
o Egypt declared a Protectorate in 1914
o Dardanelles/ Gallipoli (Ottoman Empire) – 1915 campaign
o Campaigns in Mesopotamia and Palestine → Arab Revolt led by Hussain, sharif of
Mecca & TE Lawrence → a ‘scramble for Turkey’ to establish areas of influence

•

Campaigns against the German colonial empire:
o Occupation of Togoland and Cameroon
o South African invasion of German South-West Africa
o Campaign against German East Africa
o Australian occupation of German New Guinea
o New Zealand occupation of Samoa

The Imperial contribution to the British war effort:
•

Manpower:
o Dominions contributed 1.3 million troops (conscription only ibn NZ and Canada)
(Australia: 58,500 dead; Canada: 56,500 dead; NZ: 16,000 dead; Newfoundland:
1,281 dead)
o Conspicuous examples of sacrifice: ANZACs at Gallipoli; Canadians at Vimy Ridge;
Newfoundlanders at the Somme.
o 1.4 million Indian troops mobilised – no conscription (48,000 dead) – most fought in
the Middle East and Africa
o 1.2 million Egyptians mobilised to fight in the Middle East

o

o
•

Black Africans used as labourers and porters in Europe but Black troops fought for
Britain in Africa.
1915 onwards – enlistment in West Indies (15,000 men)
Racial beliefs and expectations shaped people’s roles within the war effort

Economic:
o Dominion governments paid for their own armies and munitions
o Indian government contributed £100 million to the war effort
o Imperial Preference introduced to encourage economic self-sufficiency within the
empire

Organisation of the empire for war:
•
•
•
•

Creation of coalition in 1915 and replacement of Asquith with Lloyd George in 1916
Debates over conscription (controversial in Ireland, S Africa and Canada)
Creation of Imperial War Cabinet from 1917 (inc. Jan Smuts from S Africa and other
Dominion leaders)
Joint Imperial command of the Armed Forces

The crucial watershed in the British conduct of World War I came, both at home and in the empire,
with Asquith’s replacement by Lloyd George in December 1916. While Asquith clung to the normal
peace-time ways of running government, Lloyd George enjoyed addressing the emergency of war. It
has been said that the new Prime Minister regarded the Dominions with a sympathetic eye; it might
also be described as the hard, envious gaze of the recruiting sergeant. The Empire, in short, was to
provide the resources for the more aggressive policy followed by the Lloyd George government.
Before December 1916, Britain was at war, assisted by her empire; after December 1916, the empire
was at war, arranged by Britain as the agreed leader among equal partners. In short, the empire came
to play a much more important role in the war effort.

Summary of outcomes of the First World War for the British Empire:
•
•
•
•
•

Removal of strategic threat from Germany – Britain (together with France) remained the
hegemonic power
Expansion of territory and population (1,800,000 square miles and 13 million people)
Dominance (with France) in the Middle East
Greater imperial cooperation and trade
Huge military power including the newly formed RAF

BUT
•
•
•
•
•
•

Nearly a million dead from the whole empire
Huge economic costs: (c. £35 billion = 13x costs of Boer War) + disruption to trade and
investments; over $4 billion borrowed from USA
Growing confidence and autonomy of Dominions
Rise of nationalism in India, parts of Africa and especially Ireland
Conflicting promises of self-government to various people within the Empire
Hostility towards European imperialism from the USA (Wilson’s 14 Points)

1919 – a year of unrest:
•

•
•

Context: Wilson’s 14 Points and the promotion of nationalism and ‘self-determination’
Context: Fear of communism after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the
establishment of Comintern in 1919
Context: Mutinies against delayed demobilization and industrial strikes in the UK
Unrest: Ireland, India, Egypt, W Indies, Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan

It was arguable that the war had left the established order weakened and therefore vulnerable to the
epidemic of protest and disorder that appeared in 1919. It was also politically convenient for
defenders of that order to dismiss all assaults upon it as the products of a gigantic but ill-defined
conspiracy. Doing so ruled out any suggestion that the assailants’ grievances might be real or even
justifiable. Such attitudes, usually combined with an intense fear of communism and its capacity to
create mayhem everywhere, were prevalent among Britain’s ruling class at this time. There was,
therefore, a tendency, most common among soldiers, to classify dissidents of whatever complexion
as either dupes or cunning men who manipulated the ingenuous and fundamentally decent masses to
further their own ends. Such explanations of the causes and manifestations of discontent often made
it difficult for politicians and commanders to examined their sources dispassionately.

There was an illusory quality to Britannia’s victorious peace. True, the Empire had never been bigger.
But nor had the costs of victory, by comparison with which the economic value of these new territories
was negligible, if not negative. No combatant power spent as much on the war as Britain, whose total
expenditure amounted to just under £10 billion. That was a steep price to pay even more a million
square miles, especially as they generally cost more to govern that they yielded in revenue. The cost
of running Iraq, to give just one example, amounted in 1921 to £23 million, more than the total UK
health budget. Before 1914, the benefits of Empire had seemed to most people, on balance, to
outweigh the costs. After the war the costs suddenly, inescapably, outweighed the benefits.

➢ Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments
in this extract are in relation to the position of the British Empire after the First World
War.

The Bolshevik and Wilsonian declarations on national self-determination were accompanied by other
intellectual and political trends related to world peace, international cooperation, universal suffrage,
and women's rights. All of these emerged before or during, and merged decisively with the end of, the
Great War. The war itself was decisive in the perceived destruction of the old world and the creation
of the hopes and possibilities for a new one. After the cessation of hostilities, there was a heightened
awareness of the interconnectedness of the world and a renewed hope for its future prosperity. The
destruction of the certainties, social stability, and hierarchies of the old world by the new post-Great
War world, in Europe and elsewhere, was an enabling factor in creating a new perception of the world.
An earlier, narrower set of knowledge and experiences of interconnection among Indian elites,
soldiers or seaman (for it was the lascars who were the largest group of South Asian travellers across
the world before the Great War), was far enlarged by the war.

The emergence of nationalism
It must be questioned whether it is accurate to describe the various forms of opposition that the
British faced in their numerous colonies as ‘nationalist’ at all. Nationalism is a largely secular ideology
which spread throughout Europe over the course of the Nineteenth Century. The concept was
predicated on the idea that a ‘national’ group had a unique identity with shared linguistic and cultural
characteristics. A nation was an ‘imagined community’ and a focus of loyalty and affection. The
implication of this was that these communities had a right to ‘self-determination’ and should not be
ruled or dominated by any other national group.1 Benedict Anderson has suggested that Europeanstyle national identities were created within the different colonies and highlights the role that imperial
powers unintentionally played in developing this through their use of ‘census, map and museum.’2
However, Eric Hobsbawm has argued that, ‘a profound conflict separated the modernisers who were
also the nationalists (a very untraditional concept), and the common people of the third world’3 and
that ‘the very concept of a permanent territorial political entity…i.e. the idea of an independent
sovereign state which we take for granted, was meaningless to people.’4 Most ‘nationalists’ were
highly educated elites (often western-educated) who were imposing a European concept of
nationhood on their peoples. The fact that the borders of many modern African nations are those
arbitrarily drawn up by nineteenth-century European diplomats is testament to the fact that these
were communities imposed on Africa which bore little relation to pre-existing loyalties. Nigeria, for
instance, possessed no intrinsic unity and cannot be said to have developed discernably ‘national’
characteristics by the time of independence in 1960; it contained an assortment of different religious
communities and a collection of over 250 languages. Consequently, those who were termed
‘nationalists’ in the colonies were often a small minority that bore little relation to the mass
movements seen in Europe, and what was labelled ‘nationalism’ was often little more than a diffused
sense of resentment by the governed against the governors.5
Nationalists, therefore, had to seek support amongst more mundane grass-roots causes if they wanted
any chance of achieving their aims.6 Arguably Gandhi’s greatest success in India was his marriage of
modern, progressive, nationalist aims with traditional attitudes.7 However, building a common front
against the British was often difficult as nationalists had to compete with other groups which were
often religious or traditional in character.8 The Marxist-Christian-nationalist-pan-African Kwame
Nkrumah of the Gold Coast is an example of how even one individual could personally embody a
cocktail of different, sometimes contradictory, ideologies. It is worth noting that, even in India where
nationalism had a relatively long pedigree, the British did not face a monolithic independence

1

The phrase ‘imagined communities’ comes from Benedict Anderson’s book of the same name (Benedict
Anderson, Imagined Communities (2nd Edition) (Verso, London, 2006). However, the phenomenon is also
described in Eric Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism, 2nd Edition (Cambridge, 1992).

movement. Rather, they had to consider the competing claims of Congress and the Muslim League as
well as the situation of pre-existing indigenous elites (specifically, the semi-autonomous princes).
Within many of Britain’s possessions the pressures the authorities faced from below were far less
coordinated and can perhaps best be described with the more neutral term ‘anti-colonial’ rather than
‘nationalist’ which implies a shared ideology: ‘there are a variety of nationalist movements behind
what to the casual observer may seem like a single wave of nationalism, and these diverse groups are
frequently seriously at odds.’9
That being said, it has been argued that European-style nationalism inevitably results in the undoing
of empires, including that of the British. JR Seeley claimed in 1885 that ‘the weakness of being a mere
mechanical forced union of alien nationalities [had] brought down most empires.’10 More recently,
Dominic Lieven has pointed out that the development of the national idea and the growing popularity
of nationalism throughout the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century seems to have
proved fatal to the concept of empires: ‘nationalism was the most powerful ideology of the day,
empire stood irrevocably opposed to it, and the result was inevitable destruction.’11 Put another way,
‘Europe learned to imagine the nation from the tensions that emerged within its old empires and
passed the imaginative possibility along to its new colonial conquests.’12 This interpretation sees the
British Empire simply crumbling in the face of nationalist movements everywhere.

Reasons for growing nationalism in the inter-war period:
•
•
•
•

Population growth → pressures on land
Growing educated middle class imbued with Western ideas
Religious revivalism (esp. Islam in Middle East)
The spread of socialism (limited impact)

The British generally held in contempt those who were displaced by the occupation of their lands.
They were forced to negotiate with them in order to secure British interests, but they discounted
leaders of political parties as self-serving troublemakers. Colonial societies, so the argument ran until
at least the 1940s, we're not nations but collections of peoples; colonies were best administered by
British rulers in collaboration with their natural leaders. Self-appointed nationalists were seen as a
special interest group. Not only did British colonial administrations choose not to recognise the
possibility of connections between sporadic protests, which they managed to subdue, and nationalist
movements to which they were eventually obliged to transfer power, they also disparaged the
significance of any kind of opposition (using terms like banditry or mutiny) and constructed a
demonology of principle opponents. Winston Churchill sneered at Gandhi as ‘the naked fakir’, Sir
Charles Arden Clark (governor of the Gold Coast) referred to Kwame Nkrumah as ‘our local Hitler’, and
Sir Patrick Renison (governor of Kenya) called Jomo Kenyatta ‘a leader unto darkness and death’.

Irish Independence
Read:

1913 – Third Home Rule Bill passed → risk of civil war from resistance from Ulster Protestants → not
implemented due to outbreak of WWI
1916 – Easter Rising, Dublin, against the delay to Home Rule
1918 – General Election returns majority Sinn Fein (‘Ourselves Alone’) rather than more moderate
Irish Nationalist Party → declared an independent Irish republic and met as an independent
parliament, the Dáil Éireann, in Dublin.
1919-21 – Anglo-Irish War: the Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched a guerilla campaign against
British rule. The British recruited the ‘Black and Tans’ to assist the Royal Irish Constabulary.
1921/22 – Anglo-Irish Treaty:
o
o
o
o

The Irish Free State would become and self-governing dominion within the British
Empire
The British monarch would remain Head of State
The northern six counties would have the option (which they took up) of remaining
part of the United Kingdom and would have their own parliament at Stormont
The British would retain control over several ‘treaty ports’ for the use of the Royal
Navy

Outcomes:
o
o

o

o
o

Ireland partitioned between north and south
Eamon de Valera (one of Sinn Fein’s leaders) refused to accept the compromises of
the Anglo-Irish treaty and launched the Irish civil war (1922-23) in which the proTreaty side won.
Still unsatisfied, de Valera used the 1931 Statute of Westminster which granted
dominions complete autonomy within the empire, to effectively separate Ireland
completely. It was renamed Eire in 1937, remained neutral in WW2 and refused to let
Britain use the treaty ports.
In 1948 the Republic of Ireland Act separated Ireland completely from the British
Empire, declared it a republic and Ireland left the Commonwealth.
Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and, from 1969-1998 ‘The
Troubles’ saw sectarian conflict between the Catholic (nationalist) and Protestant
(unionist) communities there.

During the First World War the British, for short-term gain, had made several incoherent promises
throughout the Middle East:

Promises of Egyptian self-government
Sykes-Picot Agreement with France
Balfour Declaration, 1917
The MacMahon Letter, 1915

Yet, the British also sought to become the hegemonic power in the Middle East. These conflicting
ambitions and promises, combined with Britain’s already overstretched commitments worldwide,
made the British period of dominance in Middle East in the inter-war period extremely difficult.

Continuing importance of Suez: 1920s, British-registered shipping accounted for c. ¾ of vessels. Also,
strategic location considering rise of Italian and Japanese power during inter-war period. Plus,
continuing importance of Egypt’s cotton for Britain’s industry.
Gamel Abdul Nasser (b. 1918): ‘when I was a little child every time I saw an
aeroplane flying overhead, I used to shout: “O God Almighty, may a calamity
overtake the English.”’
1918 – the Wafd (led by Said Zaghul) appealed for Egyptian independence
(Wilson’s ideals of national self-determination). Wafd dominated by
effendiya landowning class and professionals.
March, 1919:
•
•
•

•

Lord Curzon (Foreign Sec.) – miscalculated and ordered a harsh
response: leading members of Wafd arrested/ exiled
→ widespread unrest: riots and strikes in towns and sabotage of infrastructure.
British showed much racial contempt towards the Egyptians: ruthless tactics including firing
on crowds and using aircraft → 1,500 Egyptians killed in 8 weeks of fighting (comparisons with
Indian Mutiny)
General Allenby brought in to deal with the situation → concessions: Wafd leaders brought
back from exile

1919, Milner Report – recommended conciliation
1922 – nominal ‘independence’ granted under King Fuad (anti Wafd and pro-British). Britain retained
control over defence, the Canal, the Sudan etc.
Wafd remained the dominant political group – appeals to patriotism gained support from poorer
classes. Some terrorist cells on the fringes.
Nov 1924 – arguments over possession of Sudan → assassination of Sir Lee Stack, Governor-General
of the Sudan, in Cairo.
1935 – Wafd organised a fresh wave of popular protest + pressures from Mussolini’s expansionism in
the Mediterranean → a settlement was needed.
1936 – Anglo-Egyptian Treaty – Full independence for Egypt but Britain still retained control of the
Suez Canal zone and garrisons and RAF bases in Egypt, and the naval facilities at Alexandria (Context:
fear of Italian aggression from Libya)
1939 – Egyptian government reluctant to declare war on Germany: King Faruq sympathetic to Axis →
forced by the British in February 1942 to appoint Mustafa al Naha (Wafd leader) as Prime Minister –
Wafd now sympathetic to the Allies. Egypt remained an important strategic location for the British
Armed Forces during WWII.

Assumption that, like Iran, oil could be found in
Mesopotamia
1919 – British administered mandate of the
League of Nations – disappointing hopes from
Arab nationalists
1919 and 1920 – revolts against British rule (esp.
from the Kurds in the north) → Kurdish uprising
crushed by British and Indian troops – high costs
to Britain (£40 million) and brutal methods. Use of air power to maintain control – cheaper.
1921 – Cairo Conference
1922 – Anglo-Iraqi Treaty – Faisal I (Hashemite Dynasty) confirmed as king of Iraq – Britain retained
control of foreign policy and defence and maintained armed forces in the country
1927 – Kirkuk oil fields open – run by Turkish Oil Company (Western financed)
1930 – Anglo Iraqi Treaty – consultation between Iraq and Britain on foreign policy but British mandate
officially ended
1932 – full independence nominally granted – although Britain retained much influence through the
dominance of the British oil industry + the RAF retained air bases in the country
1941 – British occupation of Basra in the south → Iraqi government asked for help from the Axis →
six-week campaign to restore British rule over Iraq
Persia (Iran)
Spheres of influence agreed with Russia in 1907
Reza Pahlevi – British-backed Shah from 1920
Oil discovered in 1908. Drilling for oil began in 1909 (1919: 7.5 million barrels; 1934: 57 million barrels)

The coup de main against Iraq [in 1941] and the palace coup in Cairo nine months later were proof
that, despite over twenty years of nationalist ferment, British power in the Middle East was still firm.
Both were, however, exceptional measures, undertaken in the face of dire emergencies by a country
fighting for its life. This was not how it looked to Egyptians and Arabs. Each display of force left a deep
sense of bitterness and frustration because it had amply demonstrated the victims’ powerlessness.
Britain was still the dominant power in the region and would go to any lengths to get its way there.

India, 1914-1939
In 1931 Britain officially opened its new capital of India, New Delhi. This was an enormous planned
city designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. Built near the site of the old Mughal capital, it was
designed to demonstrate the permanence and stability of British rule. At the centre of the city was
the vast Viceroy’s House, an enormous structure covering four and a half acres, with 285 rooms. It
had 6,000 staff and 400 gardeners, fifty of whom were solely employed to chase birds away. On the
North Secretariat building were inscribed the condescending words: ‘Liberty will not descend to a
people: a people must raise themselves to liberty; it is a blessing which must be earned before it can
be enjoyed.’ Allegedly the bells ornamenting the Viceroy’s House were made of stone so that they
could never ring to mark the end of the British Raj. The British would only occupy this capital for 16
years and it has spent most of its existence as the capital of the independent Republic of India.

‘1919 was a turning point in the history of India and Amritsar was the pivot’ - James

Dyer thought any act of retreat would quickly cause the Raj to unravel. For him, British power in India
was based on conquest, and conquest could only be maintained if violence was continually asserted
against the population which could quickly turn into a mob. Any kind of equality entailed a dangerous
lack of respect for India's conquerors. After a crisis, such as those of 1857 or 1919, authority could
only be restored if Indians were forced to submit themselves, sometimes humiliatingly, before their
masters. Any Indian passing along the street where the missionary Miss Sherwood had been attacked
was commanded by Dyer to crawl on their bellies. Dyer's response to riots in Amritsar was a retaliation
to an existential challenge. The way of life he had been brought up in was wrapped up with the idea
of Indian obedience to British commands. If those commands were not obeyed, Dyer would not be
able to consider himself a dignified human being. When asked why he did not just shoot to disperse
the crowd, Dyer said that ‘the people who gathered would all come back and laugh at me’. Without
the killing he said, ‘I considered I would be making myself a fool’.

How significant was Gandhi to the Indian nationalist movement?

~ 44 ~

Rather than being ignorant of the need to wield political power, Gandhi sought to exercise it in ways
which maximized Indian strength and weakens that of the British. By withdrawing the cooperation
and obedience of the subjects, Gandhi sought to cut off important sources of the ruler’s power. At the
same time, the non-cooperation and disobedience created severe enforcement problems. In this
situation, severe repression against non-violent people would be likely not to strengthen the
government, but to alienate still more Indians from the British Raj and at the same time create not
unity in face of an enemy, but dissent and opposition at home. This was a kind of political judo which
generated the maximum Indian strength while using British strength to their own disadvantage. The
view that Gandhi was ignorant of the realities of political power and that his methods of resistance
were ineffective would have been vigorously denied by every British government and Viceroy that had
to deal with him and his movement.
-

Adapted from ‘Gandhi’s Political Significance Today’ by Gene Sharp

Gandhi’s beliefs and methods were ultimately failures. Most of his Congress colleagues accepted nonviolence as a political tactic against the British Raj, but they did not believe in it as a way of life.
Gandhi’s philosophical writings on non-violence were often dismissed as ideas too lofty for ordinary
mortals. During the Second World War, Congress rejected Gandhi’s talk of defending India nonviolently against the Japanese. Gandhi wrote about the duties of the citizen and the state, but said
little about the political structure of an independent India. He believed in decentralising power as
much as possible; India would remain primarily a rural society with its base in agriculture and with
minimal industrialization. These ideas made little impression on the framers of the Indian constitution.
In 1947, little heed was paid to the Gandhian approach to government.
-

Adapted from In Search of Gandhi: Essays and Reflections by BR Nanda (2004)

Gandhi’s own people tormented him even as he brought them to the threshold of freedom. The worst
of these torments was the failure of nonviolence. Shocked by the outbreak of communal violence on
the eve of independence, Gandhi set about reflecting on how 30 years of non-violent struggle could
have produced such violence. The answer he came up with was that the struggle had never been nonviolent. It had been passive resistance, which is non-violence of the weak. As non-violence of the weak,
passive resistance is always a preparation for violence. Afraid of British reprisal, Indians had kept
repressed within them the violence they had felt all along. That long repressed violence is what had
erupted the moment the fair of the British was gone.

Sudhir Chandra, Gandhi: An Impossible Possibility (2020)

~ 45 ~

The Mahatma’s movement of non-violent resistance, with its mass following and universal claims, its
toleration of violence and the explicit desire for suffering, must surely be placed alongside the great
revolutionary movements of his time. For in many ways, Gandhi belongs in the same group as his
contemporaries, Lenin, Hitler and Mao, and should not be seen as a moralist detached from the
mainstream of twentieth-century politics. Such an appreciation of his nonviolence allows us only to
ignore Gandhi as a figure central to modern history. Yet unlike the last century’s impresarios of mass
politics, the Mahatma did not simply tolerate violence as a means towards some end but famously
prized the suffering it produced in its own right. And this made Gandhi’s dealings with violence far
more radical than those of his revolutionary peers, responsible though they might have been for much
more of it than the old man in the loincloth.
-

Adapted from Fasial Devji, The Impossible Indian (2012)

When Lord Irwin [British Viceroy between 1926 and 1931] and his British advisers learned the specifics
of the [Salt March] plan, they found the idea ridiculous, with Irwin writing ‘at present the prospect of
a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.’ The British press saw [Gandhi’s] plan as ‘childishly
theatrical’ and they hoped that the movement would die out if it was ignored. Such attitudes
demonstrated a sense of detachment from the quotidian lives of ordinary Indians. No concessions
were forthcoming, so plans were made for the Salt March. Firstly, the route needed to be mapped, so
some of Gandhi’s trusted followers were tasked with this. They wanted the Salt March to go through
villages where Gandhi could promote sanitation, personal hygiene and abstention from alcohol, as
well as the end of child marriages and untouchability. In addition, correspondent and newspaper
agencies from dozens of Indian, European and North American newspapers, along with film crews,
descended upon India to bear witness to the drama and began covering the event. This clearly
indicates how Gandhi had become a master of media and stage management, directing his satyagraha
with precision. He had drawn lessons from previous protests he had initiated, and was determined to
set the scope, and prescribe methods and intended outcomes.

•

Read: 144-149 in AQA

The British had to ask themselves: what advantages did they desire or expect to obtain from their
Empire? What devices would they adopt to ensure such benefits? During the twentieth century the
British had to make a choice between economic systems: one based on free trade between all
countries, and the other concentrating on its trade with the Empire. Before 1914 the dominant view
was that the Empire was a particularly valuable part of the international economy, but that no attempt
must be made to increase its value artificially. The First World War weakened this consensus, largely
because of the huge economic and military contribution the Empire made to the British war effort.
But after 1919, the old pre-1914 attitudes returned. It was not until after 1929, in the crisis of the
Depression, that the Empire was again seriously treated as an essential prop to the British economy.
Finally, the much greater crisis of the Second World War and its aftermath raised imperial expectations
to their highest level.

Although Britain suffered in the world slump that began in 1929, she was far less affected than her
rivals, including the United States, whose global economic influence shrank rapidly. Indeed, it is
important to remember that Britain was the only truly world power of consequence in the 1930s…
The overriding purpose of British policy, within the Empire and beyond it, was to restore or enhance
her financial influence. This priority gave direction and momentum to important decisions on
international policy, from the Ottawa agreement to appeasement; it shaped Britain’s other dealings
with the dominions and the colonies; and it dominated her aims in South America and China. In
pursuing these goals, Britain showed a degree of energy and agility that is hard to reconcile with the
view that, by the close of the 1930s, she had become and elderly and arthritic power.’
-

Adapted from British Imperialism by PJ Cain and AG Hopkins (2001)

What do Cain and Hopkins argue about the Britain’s economic position in the 1930s?

By 1933 the sterling area was central to Britain’s international economic policy. The Treasury and the
Bank of England saw it as the best means of restoring Britain’s international trade position and
salvaging a world role for sterling and the City of London from the wreckage of 1931. The sterling area
was far more than an emergency arrangement in a crisis. It appeared to offer the chance to reclaim
some of the global power lost to Britain during and since the war. Optimism about the sterling area
was widespread. Officials at the Bank of England anticipated that the gold bloc centred on France
would disintegrate and provide new recruits for the sterling area. Once leading financial journalist
claimed that London had already recovered her old financial supremacy, and the complete restoration
of her role as the world’s leading banking centre was only a question of time. Many in London believed
in the early 1930s that the sterling area would enable Britain to recover its former financial glory.

ESSAY: To what extent did the Empire remain popular in Britain between 1918 and 1939?

~ 54 ~

~ 55 ~

The old imperialism was losing some of its shine. Socialists and nationalists were making their voices
heard in Britain as well as in the colonies, and raising all kinds of doubts about the justice of Britain’s
imperial methods: not only about the excesses, like Amritsar, but also about the assumptions which
lay beneath the ordinary day-to-day administration of the empire. There was more talk of the rights
of non-Europeans, as well as of their protection; doubts about the morality of even the kindest and
best-intentioned paternalism; doubts, long-standing but bolstered most recently by the war, as to
whether Europeans, who had just perpetrated such an atrocity among themselves, had any cause to
regard themselves as superior in any way to those they were supposed to be ‘raising’ to their level.
Things which were swallowed easily enough before by most people, like the right of white emigrants
to settle where the pleased and take over countries from their indigenes, now began to stick in some
gullets. It began to be noticed that some ‘virgin’ territories were not so virgin after all, but had people
living in them who merited no less consideration just because they were inefficient… And more
generally the very possession of an empire was, among more and more people, beginning to be
regarded as alien or at least irrelevant to the best ideals of the twentieth century; imperialism losing
what pure idealists it had, to socialism or pacifism or isolationism or the League of Nations, or to some
other deity which was not so tarnished as yet. To quantify such a change in the climate of opinion
would be impossible, still more to speculate on its effect. But there can be little doubt that empire
and imperialism had a surlier, less carefree, more anachronistic and defensive image between the
wars than before.

Historiographical Debate: Public Opinion and the British Empire
In the inter-war years, thousands of British families had friends or relatives
who had emigrated to, or served in the Empire as civil servants, teachers,
missionaries, engineers, driving locomotives, and as soldiers in the British
army. All social classes were influenced in different ways. The churches
and Sunday schools provided information about the Empire, as
missionaries urged audiences to contribute to medical, educational, and
evangelical work throughout the Empire. Missionaries popularized the
notion that Western medicine was tackling the most feared tropical
diseases in the Empire. The Empire came to the British public in new ways
such as through the cinema newsreel, and through the press. British
people were, for example, well aware of the Amritsar massacre, which
generated much debate. As constitutional reform and eventually decolonization became imminent,
the British people were aware of Asian and African politicians visiting London for Round Table
Conferences. Among these was Mahatma Gandhi, who in 1931 stayed in London’s East End and visited
cotton mills, universities and schools. By these means the Empire became an integral part of British
culture.
-

John Mackenzie, The Popular Culture of Empire in Britain (1999)

Whatever else it may have been, the British Empire was not a ‘people’s
empire’. Those who say that imperialism pervaded British culture during
this period are wrong. There is no direct evidence that the majority of
Britons supported the Empire, took any interest in it, or were even aware
of it. They were too busy and too poorly educated to care, while the middle
classes and upper class imperialists were happy to keep the Empire to
themselves. Most people were less affected by empire than by other
concerns. The fact of having an empire affected hardly anyone’s
fundamental view of anything. This is what so bothered the imperial
supporters, who thought that the Empire should change people’s outlooks.
The Empire was merely tolerated, rather than celebrated – and only
provided that it did not have a negative impact on people’s lives. That was a weakness, as the
supporters of empire well knew.

It is untrue that most Britons were ignorant of or indifferent to empire; but neither was Britain
saturated by imperialism. In the twentieth century, the sources of contact between mother country
and colony multiplied and, as a result, a range of relationships with the Empire developed. There was
never a single ‘imperial culture’ in Britain. In addition, disentangling the ‘imperial’ from the
‘international’ is problematic. The dividing line between pride in the Empire and in Britain’s broader
position as a world power was not clear. The monarchy and the military can be seen as twin pillars of
popular imperial sentiment. Yet, both appealed to patriotism irrespective of their connection with the
Empire. Similarly, the growth of imperial news coverage can be too readily accepted as evidence of
enthusiasm for empire when a thirst for mere sensationalism may explain the demand for such
reporting.

In the inter-war period, the British public were not weary of or antagonistic to empire and all it
entailed. Twenty-seven million (the number of visitors to the 1924 Wembley exhibition) was a
considerable number, representing more than half the then population of Great Britain. The exhibition
also garnered huge coverage in the press. More than 2,000 articles about the British Empire Exhibition
appeared in The Times from 1923 to 1925. The mass middlebrow culture of inter-war Britain was
largely traditional and conservative. Youth literature in the adventure tradition remained replete with
militarism and patriotism. The unifying principle of empire as expressed by the exhibition – the
monarchy – also continued to be popular. – Matthew Parker, ‘The empire’s last hurrah?’ – in BBC

Uniting such a disparate empire was a challenge and, throughout the inter-war period, officials tried
to promote an appearance of unity and kinship, portraying the Empire as a harmonious and

forge this united ethos.

Relations with the Dominions – A ‘Third’ British Empire?
The First World War encouraged a greater sense of national identity within the dominions and there
was a need to clarify their constitutional status within the empire. Britain had declared war on their
behalf in 1914 and controlled their militaries for the duration of the conflict (although an Imperial
Cabinet had developed too). However, their support and sympathy could not be guaranteed into the
future. The cultural, economic and emotional ties between Britain and the ‘Big Five’ dominions varied
considerably:
Australia and New Zealand – huge losses at Gallipoli amongst the ANZACs had helped foster a sense
of identity independent to that of the mother country. However, much of the population of both were
recent migrants and retained a British identity. Both were economically dependent on trade with
Britain and suffered during the Great Depression due to their reliance on agricultural exports. The rise
of Japan made both countries nervous and determined to maintain the security provided by the Royal
Navy. Furthermore, there was a fear of mass migration from Asia that would dilute the ‘whiteness’ of
these countries. It was hoped that the continuing link with Britain would help avert this.
Canada – Canada had been self-governing for the longest of the dominions and was regarded as the
most politically developed. Again, losses in WWI such as those at Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele had
helped foster a distinct Canadian identity and this led to greater calls for an autonomous defence and
foreign policy. Canada contained a significant minority of French Canadians who had always been
much less emotionally committed to the British connection. Furthermore, Canada traded much more
with the United States to its south than it did to Britain. Nevertheless, Canada’s position within the
Empire remained strong, although it was reluctant to involve itself in matters that did not concern its
direct interests.
South Africa – Since the Union in 1910, South Africa remained in an uneasy demographic balance and
its commitment to the empire could not be relied upon. British South Africans were always in a
minority relative to Afrikaners, although the latter were divided between those who had reconciled
themselves to the imperial connection, and those who took a more republican approach. The latter
were politically organised and, under Prime Minister JB Hertzog (PM, 1924-1939), more assertive in
their defence of Afrikaner nationalism and sceptical of the British connection. It is also during this
period that Hertzog’s government started to implement stricter discriminatory measures towards the
black population of South Africa. (Although the full system of apartheid would not be implemented
until 1948).
Ireland – The Irish Free State was never committed to its status within the empire, always seen as an
unsatisfactory compromise by many since the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921-22. Irish leaders during the
inter-war period were determined to remove any lingering constraints on their autonomy and, by
1937, had essentially turned Ireland into a republic. In terms of foreign policy, Ireland was determined
to remain neutral in international disputes.

In 1925 the Dominions Office was created under the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, separate
to the Colonial Office which continued to oversee non-self-governing possessions.

~ 60 ~

1926 Imperial Conference
There had been a series of imperial conferences in London which were attended by the Prime
Ministers of the different dominions. The 1926 conference attempted to define their constitutional
status in relation to one another. Lord Balfour chaired a commission which produced the ‘Balfour
Definition’:
‘They are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate
one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common
allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.’
There was enough ambiguity in this to satisfy most points of view. High Commissioners would be
appointed (like ambassadors) to communicate between the different dominions, replacing Londonappointed Governors. It also introduced the new term ‘Commonwealth’ to describe the imperial
structure.
1931 Statute of Westminster
This legally formalized the new relationship between Britain and the dominions. Henceforth,
Westminster could not legislate for these countries, nor could London control their foreign policies
without their consent. They could make their own international treaties and would only be bound by
British treaties with their consent. To all intents and purposes they were now independent countries,
although it was assumed that continuing loyalty to the Crown and membership of the Commonwealth
would ensure mutual assistance in future.
The dominions, for various reasons, remained comfortable with the policy of appeasement in the late1930s. The impact of the Statute of Westminster can most clearly be seen in September 1939 when
each dominion declared war on Germany separately from Britain (except Ireland which remained
neutral throughout the war).

~ 61 ~

Imperial Preference, 1932 & the Sterling Area
Running counter to greater autonomy, the Ottawa Conference of 1932 introduced Imperial Preference
in the context of the Great Depression. A revival of Joseph Chamberlain’s ideas from thirty years
previously, they did not in this case herald the arrival of a fully-fledged Imperial Federation. (By a quirk
of historical fate, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced this was Joseph’s son, Nevill
Chamberlain). It was in large part the impact of economic distress that encouraged the increasingly
disparate parts of the empire to cling to each other through preferential trade. The creation of the
Sterling Area in the 1930s also ensured that Britain and the dominions were monetarily tied together.

The Balfour Report of 1926 gave birth to, and the Statute of Westminster in 1931 legally enshrined,
the concept of equality of status between Britain and the major settlement colonies. But in many ways
the notion of equality was no more than a polite fiction. All the White Dominions, save Canada, relied
ultimately on the power of Britain and her ability to defend them; Canada escaped this dependence
only because she was ultimately protected by proximity to the United States. In matters economic,
the Dominions were similarly placed. Between the wars all of them were highly dependent for their
prosperity on trade. Britain remained easily the most important trading partner of the Dominions
throughout the period, the only exception being Canada, whose trade with the United States was of
great importance. Behind trade lay finance: if anything, Dominion dependence of Britain was greater
than in trade.

Adapted from British Imperialism by PJ Cain and AG Hopkins (2001)

What do Cain and Hopkins argue about the impact of the Balfour definition and the Statute of
Westminster?

There was something paradoxical about the revived fortunes of inter-imperial trade during the 1930s.
The enhancement and revitalization of Britain’s commercial and financial relationships with the
Empire-Commonwealth were in inverse proportion to her political and constitutional standing within
the Empire. While inter-imperial trade increased, British leadership and British rule were increasingly
challenged throughout the whole imperial system. To all but the most ardent of imperialists, however,
the trade-off between declining imperial political control and power and the maintenance, even the
enhancement, of Britain’s economic and financial position, was a price well worth paying.

The Bodyline Affair, 1932
The 1932 Ashes series saw a crisis develop
which threatened to seriously damage
relations between Britain and Australia. The
English tourists were up against (arguably) the
greatest batsman of all time, Don Bradman,
who had almost single-handedly won the
Ashes for Australia in the 1930 series. The
English were captained by the upper-class,
Oxford-educated Douglas Jardine. On hearing
of Jardine’s appointment as captain, one of his former teachers at Winchester School prophesised,
‘Well, we shall win the Ashes – but we may lose a dominion.’
Jardine worked out that the only discernable weakness in Bradman’s batting was his response to high,
fast bowling that aimed at the body (bodyline). A bodyline bowl was extremely dangerous to the
batsman who would be hurried into a stroke that could be easily caught by English fielders clustered
on the leg-side of the wicket. Jardine told his best fast bowler, Harold Larwood, to use bodyline
bowling during the 1932 Ashes series against the Australian team and the tactics were hugely
successful: Bradman scored at a rate of half his Test average and England were on course to win the
Ashes.
However, during the third Test at Adelaide, the Australian captain, Bill Woodfull, was struck by the
ball, and then Bert Oldfield, the Australian wicket-keeper, was hit and fractured his skull. The
Australian crowd was in uproar at the use of the bodyline tactics, the press was hostile, and the
Australian cricket team furious. Jardine’s upper-class insouciance enraged the Australians even more.
The Australian Cricket Board sent a telegram to the MCC in London accusing the English team of ‘not
playing cricket’ and being ‘unsportsmanlike’. The British seemed not to be ‘playing the game’
according to the old public school ethos. The controversy blew up further and threatened to seriously
damage relations between Britain and Australia, at a time in the 1930s when dominion solidarity was
potentially under strain.
Politicians intervened to dampen down the controversy and the emotion gradually subsided. England
won the Ashes series but Jardine and Larwood were then quietly dropped from the team. Bodyline
bowling was not used again.

The bitter British experiences of the Easter Uprising of 1916, and of the bloody Anglo-Irish wars that
preceded the granting of Dominion status to southern Ireland as the Irish Free State in 1921, especially
left many Tories and Liberals in Britain determined not to see a repeat of that experience in India. The
‘moral authority’ of the British Empire, the opponents of a future Dominion status now argued, rested
on Britain’s hanging tough in India and refusing to concede to nationalist agitation on the nature and
pace of political reforms. The clarification of the meaning of Dominion status at the Imperial
Conference of 1926, which formalised what the British government had already acknowledge about
the autonomy of the Dominions during the peace conferences of 1919, added further difficulties in
accepting Dominion status as the stated goal of the political reforms in India. The Dominions were
now formally recognised, for all practical purposes, as independent states that could, if they so
desired, even secede from the empire itself. Few imperial policymakers at the timed were willing to
contemplate a similar path for India anytime in the foreseeable future.

Unlike their eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century counterparts, Britain’s rulers were now
circumscribed by the morality of collective security and the opinions of a mass electorate flirting with
pacifism. Both ruled out a Copenhagen-style pre-emptive strike against the Italian navy which, at a
stroke, would have saved the empire and blocked further aggression by Mussolini and Hitler. The
temper of the times as much as the temperament of the country’s rulers meant that the empire’s
strategic weakness was lamely accepted as a fact of life, and policies would be devised accordingly.
Imperial decline was now underway.

Lawrence James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (Abacus; 1998)

British strategic planning in the 1930s:
Whilst pursuing a policy of appeasement, form the mid-1930s the British started reviewing their
strategic position throughout the world:
•

•
•
•

•

Difficulties of balancing the budget with defence commitments throughout the world –
home defence was prioritised as the threat from Germany seemed to grow, development of
the RAF prioritised in particular
Strategic overstretch – threats in the Far East (Japan), the Mediterranean (Italy) and in home
waters (Germany)
£25 million on strengthening Singapore naval base, constructed between 1923 and 1937 –
but limited in its effectiveness
Rearmament:
o In 1938 Britain produced 7,940 aircraft compared to Germany’s 8,295 and America’s
2,195 – Hurricanes and Spitfires + long-range bombers + Radar
How well-prepared was the British Empire for war in 1939?

~ 66 ~

From 1929 onwards, the British system was caught up in the world’s economic and geopolitical
earthquake. Almost all the conditions on which its wealth and safety depended now looked much
more uncertain. The threat of a great power assault on British interests or territory, a remote
possibility before 1930, became increasingly real and imperial defence a more arduous task. The
contraction of world trade, and the ever-higher walls of protection, wrecked the hopes of British
exporters. Britain’s wealth and prosperity, the core of its power, seemed to be dwindling away. In
addition, nationalist ideology corroded the ‘steel frame’ of colonial rule, challenged its systems of
political influence and drove it into costly coercion. As geopolitics, economics and nationalism
converged, Britain’s loose-knit empire, far-flung, ill-defended and so reliant on trade, looked like a
hostage to fate.

-

Adapted from John Darwin, The Empire Project (CUP; 2009)

It would be easy to infer from the catalogue of economic set-backs and disappointed expectations
during the inter-war years that Britain was in irreversible decline as an imperial power. Standard
interpretations of the period emphasise Britain’s economic weakness, her faltering will-power and her
diminishing ability to maintain political control inside the Empire and influence beyond it. However,
there are grounds for thinking that these judgments are not as robust as their frequent repetition
might suggest. The resources at Britain’s disposal were less plentiful after 1914 than before, but
relatively she still remained a long way ahead of her European rivals, while the United States was only
just beginning to emerge as a world power. Britain’s position in relation to her various satellites and
dependencies remained strong.

The Second World War saw the apotheosis of the British Empire, yet it contained elements of both
the best and the worst in the Imperial relationship. During the war it was clearly demonstrated that
colonial control depended ultimately on force, albeit applied by Britain in pursuit of national survival.
On one level, a seamless robe of force and coercion linked the British response to external and internal
challenges. D-Day, El-Alamein, and Imphal thus share an Imperial relationship with the suppression of
the 1942 Indian uprising, the British occupation of Iraq, Syria, and Iran, and the shooting by police and
military of strikers in the Northern Rhodesian Copper Belt in March 1940 or in the Bahamas in June
1942. The increased authoritarianism of wartime Imperial control was but one manifestation of ‘rule
by the sword’.
The corollary to this was that, where force failed – as in Asia – the Empire was gravely, if not fatally,
injured. The failure by Britain to protect Imperial subjects had a long-term effect… Self-government,
the precise meaning of which remained unclear, was promised, most immediately to India, but the
principle, though not the timing, was conceded for the colonial empire. ‘Partnership’ and ‘colonial
development’ became maxims for the future. In part, these promises were prompted by the need to
secure internal support for the British war effort throughout the empire and to reassure the Americans
that the British Empire was not actually very imperial at all. There were those, however, who
conceived a higher purpose for colonial development and self-government. The old Colonial Office
hand, Sir John Shuckburgh, identified a ‘new angle of vision’ towards colonial problems, ‘which, if it
did not originate with the war, was greatly accentuated by wartime conditions and reactions’. He
argued that European colonial administrators had now to ‘collaborate with Colonial peoples, not, as
in the past, merely to direct them… inter-racial cooperation must be the keynote of colonial policy.’
‘We are’, he concluded, ‘in fact engaged in a race against time; and the prize of victory will not be the
perpetuation, but the honourable interment of the old system.’ Yet, honourable or not, the
‘interment’ of the British Imperial system was an inevitable consequence of the 1939-45 conflict. The
means by which the immense resources of the empire were channelled into an extraordinary
collective war effort unleashed social and political expectations that in the end could not be
accommodated, even within a reformed colonial system such as that envisaged by… the Labour
government. Paradoxically, the ultimate cost of defending the British Empire during the Second World
War was the Empire itself.

Context in 1945:

•
•

Disruption of shipping and trade supplies during WWII due to U-Boat threat – 54% of the
merchant fleet lost
High levels of government debt (£3,500 million inc. £2,500 million owed to colonies)
1/3 of Britain’s overseas economic assets sold off to pay for the war
Massive trade deficit: Exports: £350 million; Imports: £2,000 million → partly caused by an
industrial focus on armaments
Dependence on Lend-Lease from 1941
Continuing demands for high defence spending (Cold War + imperial commitments)
Demands for domestic spending (Labour Government)

Abrupt ending of Lend-Lease, 1945

Inability to support Greek Royalists against communists → withdrawal in 1947
Sterling Crisis of 1947 – devaluation of £ to $2.80 to £1

This position led to a significant reconsideration of the value of individual colonies to Britain in the
post-war period. Those where the costs outweighed the benefits would be abandoned, whereas
those that could be an economic asset were retained and investment directed towards them:
•
•

Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945
Colonial Development Corporation, 1948

Until the 1930s, the basic principle of imperial rule was that the colonies must pay their own way.
There was good reason for this: however rich, Britain could never have afforded to support the
economic development of so large an empire from its own resources. If a colony wanted to build a
railway or a port it had to borrow money and pay interest on the debt. The result was that the poor
colonies stayed poor, unless they struck lucky with gold, diamonds or some other mineral bonanza. It
was only after 1940, with the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, that Britain seriously began to
provide unrequited aid to its colonies, and even then, it was not until the 1950s that its own economy,
weakened by the Second World War, was capable of putting much capital into the colonies.
Meanwhile, between 1939 and 1947, the Empire was milked of its foreign earnings and exploited by
the bulk buying of its exports at below world prices.

Labour and the Empire, 1945-51
Unexpectedly, the Labour Party won the 1945 election by a
landslide, leading to the collapse of the wartime coalition and
the appointment of Clement Attlee (right) as Prime Minister.
The primary attraction of the Labour manifesto was its promise
to implement the recommendations of the 1942 Beveridge
Report which called for the establishment of a ‘welfare state’,
and included such ideas as full unemployment insurance, a
huge programme of council house construction, and the
establishment of the NHS. The Labour Government also
nationalised large sections of the British economy.
Many socialists were hostile to imperialism. However, it would
be wrong to think that the majority of the Labour Party sought
to dissolve the empire. Attlee was determined to relinquish parts of the empire which he was certain
could no longer be held and his primary imperial policies were withdrawal from the following:
•
•
•

India and Pakistan, 1947
Burma, 1948
Palestine, 1948

Nevertheless, most Labour politicians sought simply to refashion the empire. The empire was seen to
be a means for Britain to continue as a great power, and a means to help reconstruct Britain’s economy
after the privations of the war. In particular, it was not envisaged that Britain’s African colonies would
become independent in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Labour Government sought to be more
pro-active and interventionist in developing Britain’s colonies. As Ernest Bevin, Labour Foreign
Secretary, declared, ‘our crime is not exploitation; it’s neglect.’
Moreover, Attlee and Bevin were determined that Britain
should play a global role in the emerging Cold War. (The USA
was content for British imperialism to remain if it helped
prevent the spread of communism).

Strategic contexts: World War Two to the Cold War
•

Read: pp. 525-541 in James; pp. 198-200 in AQA

One of the most important considerations in explaining British decolonisation is the changing
international situation and the geo-political earthquakes that took place in the middle years of the
Twentieth Century. Britain’s economic strength, relative to other states, declined from the late 19th
century and this was exacerbated by the financial burden of fighting two world wars. However, the
Second World War, in particular, damaged Britain’s prestige at least as much as its finances. John
Darwin is surely correct in placing emphasis on the perilous years 1938-1942 as they are of paramount
importance in explaining why Britain’s empire dissolved.13 Before these years the collapse of the
Empire was difficult to imagine. However, the virtual bankruptcy of the British government left it
financially (and militarily) dependent on the United States with important ramifications for the future
relationship of these two countries. In addition, and of more immediate importance, were the swift
incursions into British-held territory; the German advance into Egypt and, most significantly, the
Japanese advance in the Far East meant that the British Empire looked set to collapse. From this
humiliating situation, full recovery was impossible. Indeed, the fall of Singapore and the loss of Burma
to a non-European power were of great encouragement to nationalists and it was in this context that
the ‘Quit India’ campaign was launched. After such humiliations and in the face of such a ‘colossal
emergency, the British system lacked the means to defend itself unaided and had not the faintest
hope of restoring the status quo ante.’14 Despite reconquering the temporarily lost territories after
the defeat of the Axis, Britain’s prestige and the legitimacy of its rule in Asia could not be restored.
Considered from this perspective, it seems that the Indian nationalists merely exploited a situation
handed to them by the Japanese; it was Hirohito’s military command rather than Gandhi who forced
the issue of Indian independence.
Moreover, after 1945 Britain found itself in an
international situation where the odds were stacked
against the survival of its empire outside of Asia too.
Neither the USSR nor the USA saw the maintenance
of the European colonial empires as a priority and
the onset of the Cold War resulted in meddling in
the Third World by the two superpowers who both
sought influence there for strategic and ideological
reasons.15 Britain hoped to retain influence once its
Empire had morphed into the Commonwealth.
However, this hope proved illusory. Britain could no
longer impose its will on the rest of the world and its
wartime and post-war reliance on the USA enabled
the Americans to force the hands of the British if it was deemed necessary. The Suez Crisis is clearly
the most obvious example of this when American disapproval left the British with a profound sense of
their own impotence. As Burbank and Cooper have put it, ‘The Suez fiasco was a sign of something

that had already happened – the loss of coercive capacity and political authority by the colonial powers
of Western Europe.’16
Furthermore, one of the most important products of both the Second World War and the Cold War
was the swift acceptance that empires were now a thing of the past. The fact that the two
superpowers were both ideologically hostile to European imperialism meant that nationalists now
operated in an international climate that was very sympathetic towards them. The Soviets had always
railed against imperialism and, from Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points through to the Atlantic
Charter, American disapproval had long been documented. In addition, the Second World War meant
that the racial assumptions which lay behind empire were not simply discredited in Britain, but across
the world; the intangible, if potent, force of ‘world opinion’ could be appealed to by nationalists
everywhere. Nation-states rather than rickety empires seemed to be the norm; the Axis having sullied
the latter concept completely.17 In this respect, nationalism can clearly be seen helping cause the
downfall of the British Empire. However, it was more the triumph of an abstract concept which gained
widespread acceptance as a result of geo-political events, rather than the triumph of specific
nationalist movements.

The post-war Labour government would not contemplate the Raj’s reestablishment in the face of
Indian opposition, as it believed this to be impossible in terms of manpower, expenditure, and both
British and international politics. Always practical imperialists, the British weighed the ideological and
material costs (in India and in Britain) of the Indian Raj against its benefits. After the war had ended in
1945, the British calculated that alliance with a free India in the Commonwealth was preferable to
continued dominion. Indeed, an independent India was the only viable option open to the British,
given their diminished resources and changed interest in South Asia. This was no failure of British
commitment to empire, no recoil from harsh measures in principle. In other parts of the empire they
would show themselves prepared to use force to secure imperial priorities. In 1945-6 the British
recognized, however reluctantly, that in the particular and unique circumstances of post-war India an
Imperial Raj no longer achieved the goals they sought.

The war flattened out the pretensions of empire, making ceremonial and ritual excesses look archaic,
challenging old compacts between the King-Emperor and the landed elites. It mobilised women,
workers and the urban middle classes in radical new ways. It heightened nationalism, both in India
and in Britain, so that older forms of transnational solidarity became dated and obsolete. The Raj was
left in debt, morally redundant and staffed by exhausted administrators whose sense of purpose could
not be sustained. Development and democracy were the new political aspirations for politicians in
Delhi and in London. Ultimately, the war delivered decolonisation and the Partition of 1947 – neither
of which were inevitable or foreseen in 1939. All this is not to undermine the considerable
achievement of the nationalists over the long duration, their sustained resistance to the Raj was also
essential in knocking down its foundations and creating the possibility of a new order. Both elements
interlocked. But ultimately, the timing of decolonisation relied heavily on the damage done to the
structures of the state by the war, and by the empire’s complete lack of legitimacy when the war
ended.

More than any other single individual, Gandhi was responsible for the fall of the British Empire. His
conversion to outright opposition to the British was as much religious as political. He had always been
a high-minded man seeking to do good. Then in middle life he turned himself into a religious prophet.
Politically, Gandhi solved a dilemma which had agitated Indian nationalists for a generation. Should
they adopt constitutional methods of opposition to the British or should they attempt violent
rebellion? Both methods appeared futile. Gandhi cut through the knot by proclaiming the principle of
unconstitutional but non-violent opposition. Nationalists should be prepared to break the law, to
boycott British organisations, to resign posts in the British administration, to hinder the working of
government in any way possible, but they should stick to non-violent measures. Tactically it was a
brilliant idea. The British had ample troops and weapons to smash any attempt at armed rebellion.
But against non-violent resistance the British were powerless.

Adapted from Colin Cross, The Fall of the British Empire, 1968

The Indian Empire established on 1 January 1877 would last for seventy years. In 1947 Earl
Mountbatten, the last Viceroy, handed over power to the Republic of India and the Dominion of
Pakistan into which the country had been hastily divided. This swift transformation came about mainly
through events in Europe and because British rulers had willed it. In 1917, during the worst crisis of
the First World War, a liberalising policy had been defined – ‘the increasing association of Indians in
every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a
view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British
Empire’. But independence came about more rapidly than intended. Two world wars, the second
spreading to the Far East, undermined British power and even the will to rule. Although India was
never overrun, the Japanese inflicted such damage on British prestige that they never recovered their
political hold.
-

Adapted from John Bowle, The Imperial Achievement, 1974

Early nationalist forces had first appeared on the Indian political scene in the late nineteenth century.
Elitist in character and moderate in their demands, they had presented little real threat to the British
Raj. On the outbreak of the First World War, India had presented an image of impressive loyalty.
Politicians and princes were conspicuous in their declarations of support for Britain and in the practical
help they provided. However the experience of global war between 1914 and 1918 transformed the
nature of the nationalist forces ranged against Britain. More broadly based and demanding, they
began to challenge the British for power in India. Britain responded by making a series of constitutional
concessions in provincial government while retaining control at the centre. It was to take another
world war, and a consequent reassessment of her interests in India, before Britain was prepared to
bring her imperial presence to an end.

Burma
The British had been humiliated in Burma during the Second World War. British rule in Burma had
relied on coercion more than most of their colonies; British rule was deeply resented and had
disrupted the traditional patterns of Burmese life. The history of oppression meant that there was
little loyalty to the British amongst the majority Burmese population. It was, therefore, extremely
difficult to foresee any return to stable colonial rule after 1945.

Palestine
•

Read: p. 132 in AQA; pp. 559-571 in James

In 1945 attempted Jewish migration into Palestine was high and Britain capped Jewish migration at
1,500 a month. Relations between Arabs and Jews were deteriorating further and Britain sought to
avoid making the problem more intractable. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, world opinion,
particularly in the United States, favoured a settlement in Palestine that would allow for a Jewish state.
Harry Truman, the US President, was sympathetic to the Zionist cause and supported the immediate
entry of 100,000 Jewish migrants. However, the British government was also keen to maintain support
from the Arab world who were united in their opposition to a Jewish state. For Ernest Bevin, the
Foreign Secretary, Britain’s dominant strategic interests in the Middle East outweighed sympathy for
Zionism.
There were outbreaks of terrorism throughout
Palestine by Jewish resistance groups who were
determined to force rapid British withdrawal. The
most dramatic event was the bombing of the King
David Hotel (right, housing the British HQ in
Palestine) in Jerusalem in July 1946 in which 91
people were killed. Britain’s economic position was
so weak that it couldn’t afford the high costs of
policing Palestine indefinitely where 100,000 British
troops were stationed at an annual cost of £40
million. By 1948 300 British lives had been lost in a
conflict which seemed insoluble.
In 1946 Britain hoped to create a new unified state
that would contain Arab and Jewish provinces with a large degree of autonomy. However, this ideas
was rejected by both sides and the Unites States. In 1947 Britain referred the question of Palestine to
the United Nations which favoured partition. Bevin had no intention of implementing the settlement
which was anathema to Arab opinion. In May 1948 Britain withdrew from Palestine and the United
Nations partitioned the country into two: a Jewish state (Israel) and a Palestinian Arab state.
The violence between Arabs and Jews continued, as the new state of Israel was proclaimed in May
1948. It was immediately invaded by a coalition of neighbouring Arab states: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria and Iraq. However, the Israeli’s fought back successfully and, by the ceasefire in 1949, expanded
their territory from the initial 1947 settlement.
The birth of Israel, a moment of liberation for Jews and the culmination of the Zionist ideal, was
considered a catastrophe (‘Nakba’) by the Palestinian people, 750,000 of whom fled their homes and
became refugees in neighbouring countries. The conflict between the competing nationalisms of Israel
and the Palestinians remains unsolved.

A ‘Fourth’ British Empire?18
In the late 1940s, a vacant plot of land opposite the west end of Westminster Abbey became available,
having previously been occupied by Westminster hospital and the old Stationery Office. Such a
premium site so near to the centre of government was of great value and the Labour Government
knew just what it wanted to do with it: ‘there is no more worthy use for this fine position that as the
headquarters of our Colonial Empire’ argued the Labour minister, Lord Henderson, when introducing
a bill into parliament to acquire the site for this purpose. Having been scattered around a series of
inadequate offices in Whitehall, a new, modern Colonial Office would be constructed in the heart of
London, ready to lead the development of the British Empire long into the future.

The continued importance of empire (Part 1: Economics):
1. Development of colonial possessions to encourage economic growth
o Attempt to increase dollar reserves through investment in colonial exports
o 1948: Colonial Development Corporation to coordinate this
o Example of success: Malayan rubber
o Example of failure: Tanganyika Groundnuts Scheme, 1948

Problem: Commonwealth countries and colonies relied on export of
a limited range of primary products to Britain (lack of diversity)
2. Development of colonial possessions for the sake of ‘trusteeship’ – to justify imperial rule
in the post-war world
o The Empire would centre on Africa and the economic and social development of the
colonial peoples there

Problems: There was never enough money available to invest in
development on a large scale. The development that did occur tended to
displace the traditional indigenous elites on whose collaboration the British
had relied, and encouraged a new, literate, articulate class of nationalists.

Post-war economic development of the empire

‘Far from drawing the lesson not that economic weakness and strategic exposure had made their
overseas empires an unprofitable burden, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium reached the
opposite conclusion. To rebuild their war-shattered economies, they needed cheap raw materials and
tropical commodities that they could resell for dollars - the dollars to help pay for their essential
imports from the United States. Their colonies now seemed the perfect source: they could be forced
to accept payment at below the world price, and in Europe soft currencies not hard American dollars.
Cocoa from West Africa, copper from the Congo, tin and rubber from Malaya, sugar, coffee and oil
from the Dutch East Indies would keep the Wolf from the door until the Metropolitan economies got
back into balance.’
-

John Darwin, After Tamerlane, (Penguin, 2007)

Far from being abandoned after 1947, the Empire was repositioned in Africa, Malaya and, informally,
in the Middle East. These regions were sources of vital supplies and contributed through their dollar
earning. Britain’s new colonial policy needs to be interpreted with Britain’s economic priorities in
mind. By forming the Colonial Development Corporation in 1947, Britain hoped to promote the
production of food and other raw materials urgently needed at home and use the colonies to earn
dollars on the world market. It is no coincidence that the areas over which the British most wanted to
maintain imperial control were the regions of greatest economic value in the period of post-war
reconstruction.
-

PJ Cain and AG Hopkins, British Imperialism (2001)

What do Darwin & Cain and Hopkins argue about British imperialism in the post-war period?

The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, 1940 and 1945, established the principal that the British
government would invest directly (and encourage investment from others) in Britain’s tropical
colonies. The latter Act made £120 million available for this. The hope was that rapid economic growth
in Britain’s colonies would be a motor that could help Britain’s own economy back into growth. The
Colonial Development Corporation was set up in 1948 to coordinate this.

~ 97 ~

From 1943 Britain and the USA engaged in what was known as ‘reverse lend lease.’ This meant that
wartime United States loans to Britain were repaid partly by raw materials shipped from British
colonies to the USA. Tin and rubber from Malaya were very important in that context, while Africa
supplied a wide range of products, both mineral and agricultural. Cocoa was third as a dollar earner
after tin and rubber. In 1947, West Africa cocoa brought over 100 million dollars to the British dollar
balance. Besides, having a virtual monopoly over the production of diamonds, South Africa was able
to sell to the USA and earn dollars for Britain. It was on this very issue of currency that the colonial
government did the most manipulations to ensure that Africa’s wealth was stashed away in the coffers
of the metropolitan state.

Walter Rodney, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa (1972)

Case Study One: Malayan Rubber
Rubber had been grown in Malaya from the late 19th century and, alongside tin, it became the
centrepiece of the Malayan export economy. British planters established large rubber estates, mainly
worked by Chinese and Indian migrant labourers, and their profits soared after the invention of the
pneumatic tyre. As the US automobile industry took off into the 20th century, Malaya exported half
the world’s production of rubber by 1939. This was a major buttress of
the Sterling Area, with rubber exports to the USA running at $118 million
a year. However, the Japanese occupation during the Second World War
devastated the rubber industry; the plantations became virtual
wastelands.
By 1947 rubber production had once again reached its pre-war peak and,
by 1952-3 Malaya was providing 35.26% of Britain’s net balance of
payments with the dollar area. The Korean War (1950-53) caused the
price of rubber to increase dramatically (due to increased US demand for
military vehicles) and this only served to confirm Malaya’s economic
value to Britain; Malaya remained an extremely important possession
and this helps explain why the British were so determined to prevent it
from falling into the hands of a communist regime during the Malayan
Emergency from 1948 onwards.

Case Study Two: The Tanganyika Groundnuts Scheme
Tanganyika had been an economic backwater prior to the Second World War and, with the newfound
impetus behind colonial development, the Labour Government after 1945 decided to back a scheme
that aimed to grow groundnuts (peanuts) on 3 million acres in Tanganyika. The hope was that this
would bring economic development to this part of the empire, and supply the UK with a ready supply
of nuts that could be used to manufacture various products including margarine.
However, the entire project quickly turned into a fiasco. Land needed to be cleared and, in the process,
workers were harassed by wild animals, including bees, heavy machinery was ruined by trying to dig
in the hard soil, and workers went on strike.
Eventually some nuts were planted but a lack
of irrigation and a drought ruined the first
crop. In the end, only 47,000 acres were
cleared and planted (much less than the initial
aim of 3 million) at a colossal total cost of £36
million. The scheme was costing six times as
much to produce the crops as the crops were
actually worth. In 1951 the whole project was
written off as a failure.

~ 99 ~

The continued importance of empire (Part 2: Geopolitics):
‘The argument for empire was not solely economic. A crucial part of the British case for staying put in
the Middle East was geostrategic. Soviet aggression in central Europe, the strategists argued, could
best be deterred by the use of air power - the huge bomber force the British had deployed against
Nazi Germany. Russia's industrial cities were beyond the range of Britons own airfields, but from its
Middle East bases they could be bombed at will. The British imperium in the Middle East would make
up for British weakness close to home in Europe. France's post war leaders were also convinced they
needed their empire as much if not more so. After France's defeat in June 1940 it had been the African
colonies that had rallied to ‘Free France’. Any hope of recovering France’s pre-war status as one of the
world's great powers seemed to depend on keeping the empire intact, not least as a source of military
manpower.’

Maintenance of informal empire: protection of strategic interests through the
Commonwealth after formal decolonisation
Continuation of the ‘dominion’ idea → bonds of friendship = strategic allies

Cultivation of sympathetic elites to whom power could be handed
Britain would retain its ‘great power’ status and rival the two superpowers as a

The Conservatives and the Empire, 1951-1957
Churchill returned to office at the head of a Conservative
majority government in 1951. He was now 77 years old and,
despite no reduction in his ambition, he lacked the energy that
he had had ten years earlier. Despite the loss of India, Churchill
was determined to maintain Britain’s position as a world
power, able to deal on equal terms with the United States and
the USSR. In his view (in common with Attlee before him),
Britain and its Commonwealth must remain an independent
force in the world.
His Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden (right), was ambitious for
the top job and became increasingly dominant in the
government. Although Eden was much younger and seen to be
a glamorous, energetic minister, his health was poor and he
found his work increasingly stressful.
The United States was less concerned to encourage decolonisation than they had been as they feared
newly independent states might become prey to communism and Soviet influence. However, Churchill
and Eden found that they faced many of the problems the previous Labour government had faced.
Britain’s economy was still struggling to recover from the 1940s. It faced competition from Japan,
France and West Germany whose economies were recovering rapidly from the devastation of the
Second World War. The Treasury was increasingly worried about Britain’s commitments around the
world and the weight of colonial and defence spending.
Churchill’s government saw the following imperial events:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Moves towards independence in the Gold Coast and Nigeria
The independence of the Sudan, 1956
Attempts to create an East African Federation
The creation of the Central African Federation
The beginning of the Mau Mau Emergency in Kenya
The continuation of the Malayan Emergency
The onset of the Cyprus conflict

Throughout the priority was to maintain Britain’s strategic position and influence throughout the
world, whether through formal or informal means.
In 1955 Churchill finally retired as Prime Minister and he was succeeded by Eden. Eden premiership
would be defined by the Suez Crisis in 1956. The humiliation that resulted from this would lead directly
to his resignation in 1957.

In 1956 it fell to Anthony Eden to learn the harshest lesson about how the days of Emprie were well
and truly over. As the British were about to discover, the appearance of dominance in the Middle East
was illusory, not so much because of anything observable, but because of a change in world opinion.
When the military leader, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser seized control of the Suez Canal in July 1956,
he brought Britain into a head-on collision with reality. This was the crisis which gave the British
Empire its fatal wound. The Egyptian nationalisation of the Suez Canal was not an imperial question
but an international one. But there was a sense of imperial anger at work in Britain; Egypt had, after
all, spent decades as the Veiled Protectorate. Race played its parts too. What finished off British
delusions about the country’s place in the world was not what happened in Cairo or London, but
attitudes in Washington. The Suez blunder was at least as great an imperial blunder as the fall of
Singapore. The toothlessness of the British lion had been demonstrated to the world.

Why did Britain remain interested in maintaining its power in the Middle East?
What was the impact of the Suez Crisis on Britain and its empire?

~ 104 ~

Was Suez the beginning of decolonization? Historiographically the battle-lines are drawn between
those who make a high estimate of the effects, and those who feel they can be exaggerated. Anthony
Low believes that it is always local nationalist pressure which forces transfers of power, and Suez is
therefore ‘irrelevant’. By contrast, Roger Louis takes the view that ‘if there is any single event that
marks the turning-point in the dissolution of the African empires, it is the Suez Crisis of 1956.’ This, to
my mind, is a significantly stronger position, because: (1) Suez broke both the British imperial grip and
the French cultural grip on the crucial area of the Middle East; (2) it forced a reconsideration of military
deployments, which improved the prospects of Malta and Cyprus for self-government, and enabled
Ceylon to get rid of British bases; (3) it had a psychological impact on Macmillan’s colonial policy, even
if he could not act immediately; and (4) it made Britain ‘Public Enemy Number One’ at the United
Nations for the next dozen years or so, with major implications for decolonization.
One final observation may be made. Suez was the most divisive political event of the last half-century
in Britain, hugely more electrifying to public opinion than Thatcher’s action in the Falklands or Blair’s
in Iraq. It was a moment of blinding revelation for many British people that the days of empire were
numbered. It completely shattered the automatic trust and confidence of younger generations – and
some older ones as well – in the good faith and honesty of their governments. Politicians would no
longer get the benefit of the doubt. No subsequent generation would be as unquestioning as the last
cohorts of national servicemen. Suez was for many a source of irreversible enlightenment, not least
when evaluated in conjunction with John Osborne’s seminal play at the Royal Court Theatre, Look
Back in Anger (May 1956), which seemed to validate a subversive outlook on life and politics. From
this point onwards, deference to the Establishment, and indeed all establishments and hierarchies,
would wither away. There was a new generation of protest, with criticism of foreign, imperial and
nuclear arms policies better organised and more widespread than ever before. Press outrage was kept
alive after Suez by a series of shameful incidents in Africa in the next few years. The anti-apartheid
movement reached by the late 1950s what was probably the peak of its popular support. Of all of this,
Macmillan, succeeding Eden as Prime Minister, was acutely aware. Public opinion had never been able
effectively to lead governments where they did not want to go in overseas policy, and this did not
change. Nevertheless, the new critical awareness of the public, and its willingness to take an ethical
stand, was an important development.

Was the Suez Crisis the key turning point in the dissolution of the British Empire?

After Suez, Britain’s decolonisation proceeded rapidly under Eden’s successor, Harold Macmillan. From 1959
onwards, the remainder of Britain’s African empire rapidly slipped away. Just as an Egyptian crisis had
propelled Britain’s involvement in the scramble for Africa after 1882, it was an Egyptian crisis that prompted
Britain’s scramble out of Africa.
Macmillan initially continued Eden’s colonial policy for the first two years of his premiership. In 1957 a review
into Britain’s colonial policy concluded that decolonisation should not be rapid, that Ghana’s independence
was unique, and that independence for other African colonies would not come until the 1970s at the earliest.
In 1958 Whitehall proposed that spending on colonial development actually be increased.
British power in the eastern Mediterranean was sustained after the Suez Crisis. Malta remained British until
1964 when Britain negotiated base rights. Cyprus remained (and remains) Britain’s headquarters in the
eastern Mediterranean with significant bases there.
Anthony Eden’s successor, Harold Macmillan, accepted the realities of Britain’s shrunken status. He was
widely liked in Washington as he accepted the inexorable logic of geopolitical relations that pointed in the
direction of decolonisation.
Leading Conservative ministers had long been worried about the resources available to the government: the
welfare state was popular but hugely expensive, and higher taxes would have been politically unpalatable.
Pruning back overseas commitments and the empire was the least politically-damaging option as the British
electorate had more important priorities.
After the loss of their pre-eminence in the eastern Mediterranean, defence reforms in 1957 reduced the scale
of Britain’s armed forces and their commitments overseas, ended national service, and focused on the
development of Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent as the core of the country’s defence. This curtailed
Britain’s ability to intervene in future colonial disputes.
The 1957 review of Britain’s defence policy was started before the Suez Crisis and confirmed longer-standing
trends: that Britain would reduce the size of its armed forces and place more emphasis on the nuclear
deterrent. These policies responded to public opinion and were Conservative policy from 1954.
The British economy was already over-extended before Suez. The crippling costs of the welfare state and Cold
War defence were already apparent to the Bank of England and the Treasury. The Suez Crisis simply confirmed
sterling’s weakness and made this fact more widely known.
The decisive watershed for Britain’s position in the Middle East came in 1958 with the Iraqi revolution which
replaced the pro-British government with a more radical, anti-western regime that established relations with
the USSR. From then on, British influence in the Middle East was restricted to the Persian Gulf.
According to Beloff (1989), Suez brought about ‘a general acceptance in the Conservative Party of the fact
that the dominance of the United States in world affairs could not be challenged and that the path of safety
was at almost any cost to align British policy with that of the United States.’ Macmillan embodied this thinking
and abandoned the Conservatives’ traditional position as the ‘imperial’ party. Instead they emphasised the
‘special relationship’ with the United States.
According to Louis and Robinson (1994), the Suez Crisis showed how ultimately the empire’s future hinged on
American attitudes. ‘Once and for all, it was established that Britain had to work in concert with the United
States… Suez had exposed the American essentials underlying British power for all to see.’
Britain remained committed to intervention in the Middle East after Suez. For example, Britain intervened in

and only withdrew from their in 1967 because of pressure from a nationalist insurgency. It was not until 1971
that Britain pulled its forces out of the Persian Gulf.
Harold Macmillan only decided to investigate membership of the EEC in 1961 after South Africa left the
Commonwealth, not in the immediate aftermath of the Suez Crisis.
No longer the party of empire, the Conservatives under Macmillan looked to the developing European
Community as the economic focus of Britain’s future. It was under Macmillan that Britain first applied to join
the European Community in 1961 (unsuccessfully).
Britain’s leadership of the Commonwealth was damaged over the Suez Crisis, especially as Nehru and India
sided with Egypt. Britain became ‘Public Enemy Number 1’ at the United Nations.
Decisions to transfer power in Ghana and Malaya in 1957 were taken before the Suez Crisis and could not
have been accelerated by it. Decolonisation was, instead, determined by the force of nationalism which was,
in turn, conditioned by the unique strength of nationalism in each individual colony.
After Suez, the United States still encouraged Britain’s overseas position when this was beneficial. The USA
relied on British power in the Far East and urged Britain to continue its colonial role in Hong Kong as a symbol
of the ‘free world’. In 1961 the US aided Britain’s defence of Kuwait when it was threatened by Iraq.
Britain remained committed to its role in the Far East after 1956. The Anglo-Malayan defence agreement of
1957 allowed for the continued stationing of British armed forces in the country and Singapore remained an
important British overseas base.
For Cain and Hopkins (2001), the crisis highlighted ‘the contradiction between upholding sterling and funding
the military operations needed at times to defend Britain’s world role… This searing experience caused
Macmillan to undergo spontaneous conversion: after 1956, the advocate of empire and coercion stood foursquare for sterling and peace.’
For Lapping (1987), ‘everybody saw that the imperial gunboat no longer worked.’ After the crisis, Egypt
became a centre and inspiration for anti-colonialism while both the Americans and Soviets began more
proactive campaigns to win the ‘hearts and minds’ of Africa.
It has been argued that the Suez Crisis damaged faith in Britain’s ruling elite; that it helped speed up changing
social and cultural attitudes that ended deference and encouraged new values and attitudes that challenged
the status quo and had no time for or interest in the empire.
Nasser’s triumph over Britain and France inspired nationalists throughout the world. In the rest of Britain’s
African colonies, there was now confidence amongst nationalist leaders that Britain could be resisted
successfully.

~ 107 ~

It is not clear when the old empires realised that the Age of Empire was definitely at an end. Certainly,
in retrospect, the attempt by Britain and France to reassert themselves as global imperial powers in
the Suez adventure of 1956 seems more doomed than it evidently did to the governments of London
and Paris, who planned a military operation to overthrow the revolutionary Egyptian government of
Colonel Nasser, in conjunction with Israel. The episode was a catastrophic failure (except from the
point of view of Israel), all the more ridiculous for the combination of indecision, hesitation and
unconvincing disingenuousness by the British prime minister, Anthony Eden. The operation, barely
launched, was called off under pressure from the USA and ended for good what has been called
‘Britain’s Moment in the Middle East’, the epoch of unquestioned British hegemony in that region
since 1918.
-

E. Hobsbawm, Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century 1914–1991, 1995

What brought Eden down was not an American stab in the back; Britain’s crisis was in reality selfinduced. Until 1956 it remained the assumption in Britain, particularly among the general public, that
the country was still a great power. India had been lost but most of the other colonies and territories
remained part of the British Empire, or the Commonwealth as it was now named and British influence
continued to pervade Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Suez exposed the extent of Britain’s
pretensions. Eden had tried to take an independent line in the Middle East, only to discover that
Britain lacked the means to do so. Her armed forces were ill-prepared, she antagonised world opinion
by her spurious cover-story, she lacked the bases and air transports needed for a swift operation and
her economy was vulnerable to American pressure. The outcome was the worst humiliation in
Britain’s twentieth century history, beginning a long period of introspection and doubt.
-

D. Dimbleby & D. Reynolds, An Ocean Apart, 1988

Because Eden had suspected that the United States was ‘out to replace the British Empire’, he had
made the cardinal mistake over Suez, as Churchill intimated, of not ‘consulting the Americans’. His
successors, recognising their country’s satellite status, did not make the same mistake – quite the
opposite. For his part, Eisenhower aimed to employ the British Lion, injured though it was, in his
struggle with the Russian Bear. This meant rebuilding the damaged alliance and shoring up Britain’s
position in the Middle East. Contrary to myth, therefore, the imperial legions did not march home in
1956. Of course, London’s freedom of action was circumscribed by Washington. But, although Suez
brought the Commonwealth to ‘the verge of dissolution’, according to the Canadian foreign minister
Lester Pearson, it remained a global body. And Britain, possessing other allies as well as nuclear
weapons, still aspired to be a great power.

The end of Britain’s informal empire in the Middle East?
In certain respects, the Suez Crisis was not a turning point, but merely a symptom of a wider collapse
of Britain’s power in the Middle East. Encouraged by the independence of India, riled by the partition
of Palestine, and resentful of perceived British perfidy, Arab nationalism was growing in force after
1945. A series of events throughout the region emphasized the collapse of the British imperial
position:
•
•
•
•
•
•

1951 – election of Mohammad Mussadiq’s nationalist party in Iran/ Persia – nationalization
of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
1953 – Mussadiq overthrown by a CIA-funded insurrection and replaced with Shah
Mohammad Reza, an American client ruler (until 1979)
1958 – overthrow of British client King Faisal II of Iraq
1965-1975 – British support for the Omani monarchy against Marxist partisans
1967 – withdrawal from Aden following a guerilla conflict
1971 – Formation of the United Arab Emirates and British withdrawal from the Gulf States

Throughout the period, the United States gradually pushed Britain aside as the paramount power in
the region. Turkey was courted and joined NATO in 1951. Meanwhile, large US loans went to Saudi
Arabia and the US became the primary supporter of Israel.
Nevertheless, Britain remained an important ally of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Gulf States. In 1991
it participated in the Gulf War after Saddam Hussein’s Iraq had invaded Kuwait. Then again, in 2003,
Britain joined the USA in invading and occupying Iraq. In 2018 Britain reopened a permanent Royal
Navy base in Bahrain.

Britain’s dominance of the Middle East had not been sought, colonial fashion, as an end in itself, but
as a means of safeguarding communications with the Raj in India. When the protection and stability
of the Middle East were recognised as necessities in their own right because of its vast oil potential,
even nostalgic imperialists on the extreme right recognised that the imposition of more direct control
was no longer an option. It is also worth remembering that, from 1919, Britain’s tutelage was explicitly
intended to continue only until her dependencies had developed to the point when they could look
after themselves. In that sense Britain’s misjudgement related even more to the pace of history than
to her purposes in it.

•

pp. 203-207 in AQA

Perhaps the most important reason why many in Britain were content with the Empire’s
disappearance was the fact that Britain’s economic situation no longer made it viable. While it is
undoubtedly true that both the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires managed to stagger on for an
inordinately long time without dynamic economies, for the British, the profits and prosperity it
brought had been one of the principle reasons for the Empire’s existence: ‘By the mid-1950s, France
and Great Britain were adding up the costs and benefits of colonial rule more carefully than ever
before and coming up with negative numbers.’19 Once the Empire began to be a financial burden, it
was, perhaps, understandable why its dissolution was not resisted. In addition, Britain’s imperial and
military power had always rested on its industrial and commercial pre-eminence relative to other
powers. However, this was eroded from the late nineteenth-century onwards and the United Kingdom
was eclipsed by larger and more dynamic economies such as the USA, Russia/The USSR and
Germany.20 The two world wars speeded up this process and, post-1945, Britain’s economy was
unable to sustain the trappings of Great Power status.21

European-wide economic recovery in 1950s – Marshall Aid
Formation of EEC – Treaty of Rome, 1957

British entry to the EEC, 1973

From the mid 1950s to mid 1960s the trading ties between the colonies and Britain declined as Britain
edged closer to Western Europe and North America. International trade in manufactured goods and
services became more valuable than that in raw materials and food. The colonies subsequently
became less attractive to British exporters looking for markets with higher incomes. There was also
more competition for Britain from other industrial countries who were supplying goods to Britain’s
colonies and ex-colonies by the 1960s. Britain’s decision to apply for membership of the EEC both
reflected its rapidly expanding trade with nearby Europe and the decline of that with its far flung
imperial trading partners. It also reinforced this trend, even though Britain’s entry to Europe was
delayed until 1973.

Changing international relations: 1950s-1960s
The Cold War dominated international relations by the 1950s and decolonisation was a process that
occurred within its shadow. Although it remained the third most powerful country in the world, it was
clear that, by the 1950s, British power was significantly inferior to that of the United States and the
Soviet Union (despite developing its own independent nuclear deterrent in 1952).
Britain’s alliance (the ‘special relationship’) with the United States rested on shared values and shared
sacrifice in the Second World War. The two countries were also close military and intelligence allies
during the Cold War and, together, were the most significant military powers in NATO. An AngloAmerican Mutual Defence Agreement in 1958 resulted in close cooperation in nuclear weapons and
supplied the British with American-designed missiles.
Yet, the Suez Crisis of 1956 revealed that Britain struggled to act independently of the United States.
America remained hostile to empire on principle, and the interests of the Cold War would take priority
– this could lead to a tolerance for British colonialism (e.g. in Malaya), or hostility to it (e.g. in the
Middle East).
British post-war foreign policy is often regarded as focusing on ‘three circles’: three important
relationships that need to be held in balance:

British Empire and
Commonwealth

'Special
Relationship' with
the USA

Western Europe

~ 112 ~

However, these relationships were never equal and the 1950s and 1960s saw significant changes in
Britain’s international relations:
•

•

•

An unequal relationship with the United States and growing military and economic
dependence
o NATO and nuclear alliance
o Withdrawal of Britain from the Greece as a sphere of influence (and hand over to the
USA)
o Marshall Plan - $3.3 billion given to the UK
o American reactions to the Suez Crisis
An increasingly distant relationship with the Commonwealth and the Dominions
o Decreasing importance of trade with colonial and Commonwealth markets
o Canadian membership of NATO and closeness to the United States in trade and
defence
o Australian, New Zealand and Singapore – reorientation to the USA as guarantor of
security in the Pacific – formation of SEATO in 1954
o Determination of India and other Commonwealth countries to pursue an independent
foreign policy – formation of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1956
A developing relationship with Western Europe
o Within the NATO alliance, Britain’s defence policy had to be focused on Europe – the
defence of West Germany and patrol of the North Atlantic
o Growing trade with an increasingly prosperous Western Europe
o Applications in 1963 and 1967 to join the European Economic Community

application to the EEC.

Contrasts: The French experience of decolonisation
French defeat by Nazi Germany in 1940 and then Japan in 1942 was more destabilizing to the French
Empire than the Second World War was to the British Empire. Charles De Gaulle’s Free French forces
competed with the collaborationist Vichy forces for control of France’s colonial empire, and the
humiliation of occupation completed undermined France’s claims to be a strong imperial power.
France attempted to re-establish control of its empire after 1945. However, this proved to be an
almost impossible task and the subsequent process of decolonisation was extremely violent and
traumatic both for the French people, and for their colonial subjects.
The 1946 Fourth Republic relabelled the French Empire as the ‘French Union’ where colonies had some
representation in the National Assembly in Paris. The French conception of empire was that the
colonial territories would formally become part of France, abolishing any distinction between
metropole and periphery, except representation would have to be skewed to ensure that white French
remained in a majority.
Indo-China
France recolonised Indo-China in 1945-6 after
Japanese occupation in WWII. However, the
communist-nationalist Viet Minh (led by Ho Chi
Minh) who had resisted the Japanese, now
resisted the French and began a guerrilla campaign
for independence. Cold War priorities (leading to
US support) and lobbying from French business
and settlers meant the French were dragged into a
long conflict whereby they found it impossible to
fully re-establish their control over the country.
In March 1954 a French army was destroyed at the battle of Dien Bien Phu and the French were forced
to negotiate withdrawal and a peace at Geneva in 1954. Indo-China (Vietnam) would be partitioned
between the communist north and a western-supporting south, pending elections. It was to forestall
any risk that the entirety of the country would become communist that the USA gradually became
sucked into a conflict that would define the 1960s.
Algeria
The position in Algeria was complicated by the fact that, throughout the 19th century, it had become
a colony of settlement for France, numbering around 1 million people (10% of the population). The
indigenous Muslim majority, faced with economic deprivation and a lack of political rights, started to
resist French rule from the end of the Second World War.
The National Liberation Front (FLN) in Algeria waged a terrorist/ guerilla campaign from 1954 to 1958.
French settlers and collaborating Arabs were targeted in attacks and the French sent over 400,000
troops to deal with the insurgency. In the wake of the humiliation of Dien Bien Phu, the French
commanders were determined to succeed in Algeria. Over a million died in a conflict that would be
one of the bloodiest chapters in European decolonisation. In contrast to Indo-China, there was little
sympathy from the United States which recognised that the FLN were motivated more by Islam which

~ 114 ~

proved a barrier to communist ideas. The Cold War context, therefore, had little impact on the
situation.
Caught between the reality of the situation on the one hand, and the demands of the Army and the
French settlers on the other, a succession of weak governments in Paris failed to deal with the
situation. In 1958 the Fourth Republic collapsed and Charles de Gaulle, wartime hero of France, came
out of retirement to lead the nation. He redesigned the constitution, establishing the Fifth Republic
with a strong executive presidency (himself). Despite promises to the army and the Algerian settlers,
he was a realist and determined to relinquish France’s colonial role.
Having fought the FLN to the negotiating
table, De Gaulle was determined to offer
Algeria a referendum on its future, a
policy for which he got support from the
French people in a referendum in 1961.
Against staunch resistance from the
settlers and the army, De Gaulle granted
Algeria full independence in 1962. Most
French settlers migrated to France, along
with large numbers of pro-French Algerian Arabs.

France’s defeat and humiliation in the Second World War left it with a harder task to re-establish its
position after 1945 than Britain. Nevertheless, the violence and turmoil that then accompanied French
decolonisation inevitably had an impact on the British Empire.

The Conservatives and the Empire, 1957-1964
Anthony Eden resigned in 1957 in the aftermath of the
Suez Crisis. He was replaced by Harold Macmillan (right,
former Chancellor of the Exchequer). Macmillan’s main
concern was to revive the fortunes of the Conservative
Party, and the reputation of Britain after the humiliation
of Suez.
Macmillan was an effective politician (nicknamed
‘Supermac’) and, buoyed by a growing economy, he led
the Conservative Party to another victory in 1959. Like his
predecessors, Macmillan sought to confirm Britain as a
dominant power in world affairs. However, he was a
pragmatist and it is under his premiership that British
decolonisation accelerated rapidly.
He established a Cabinet Colonial Policy Committee to
evaluate the benefits of the colonial empire and its findings recommended a leisurely route towards
independence. In 1959, however, Macmillan decided on a quicker process. The appointment of Iain
Macleod as Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1959 was crucial. Macleod aspired to be the last
Colonial Secretary; he was sympathetic to African nationalism and feared bloodshed if nationalist
aspirations were delayed further.
Within the Conservative Party, younger, modernising MPs had taken their seats after the 1959 election
and they weighed up the strengths and drawbacks of continued colonial rule with a detached
pragmatic eye. They began to dominate over the shrinking reactionary group of Conservatives who
wished to retain the empire at all costs (The Monday Club).
In 1960 Macmillan made a six-week tour of African colonies that ended in South Africa where
apartheid and white dominance were in the ascendant. He made a significant speech to the South
African parliament in Cape Town, warning them of the enormous changes that were currently
sweeping Africa: ‘the wind of change is blowing through this continent. Whether we like it or not, this
growth of national consciousness is a political fact.’ This speech was not well-received by the white
South African politicians. Nevertheless, it marks the point at which it was clear the British Government
was committed to African decolonisation as quickly as was practically possible.

❖ What explains the decision of Macmillan’s government to decolonise quickly?

~ 116 ~

In February 1957, Harold Macmillan became Prime Minister. He was not committed to the Empire as
Churchill and Eden had been. He was a political adventurer, able to change course if it served his
purpose. He aimed above all to secure the friendship of the United states and, equally, to avoid conflict
with African nationalism. He requested a balance sheet that would indicate whether each colony was
a liability or an asset. But the economic and military issues were too complex for this to be done.
Macmillan, however, decided independently that the empire was an undesirable burden and that he
could only get back on good terms with the Americans by showing that Britain no longer possessed an
aggressively imperialist mentality. He recognised too that international sentiment was now against
colonialism. While the British could cope with limited colonial insurgency, they could not deal with
major colonial warfare. The British parliament and public would not tolerate it, nor would the
economy sustain it.

Key Individual: Iain Macleod
•

Read: ODNB entry by David Goldsworthy (focus on
his tenure as Colonial Secretary).

Macleod had no previous experience in overseas policy and indeed had never set foot in a colonial territory. But his very lack
of experience enabled him to think colonial policy afresh. This he did in accordance with his conviction—reinforced earlier
in 1959 by the Hola Camp deaths in Kenya and the disturbances in Nyasaland—that ‘we could no longer continue with the
old methods of government in Africa and that meant inexorably a move towards African independence … although it was
extremely dangerous to move quickly it would have been far more dangerous to try and hold back the tide of African
nationalism.’
More succinctly he told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the last colonial
secretary. In retrospect Macleod perceived himself as having 'telescoped events rather than created new ones' (Macleod
and Kirkman, 3). His telescoping was done with the general support of the prime minister, who during 1960 was often to be
seen in parliament with an arm around Macleod's shoulders; although at times Macmillan was startled by Macleod's speed,
and he did not always take Macleod's side in the disputes over central Africa which Macleod had with his ‘balancer’, the
much more cautious Commonwealth secretary, Duncan Sandys.
Surveying his 'dismal inheritance' (Macleod and Kirkman, 8) in October 1959, Macleod decided that he must grasp the nettle
immediately in Kenya and central Africa, where political and racial tensions were running high.
The historian Roger Louis considered that 'Macleod was to Africa as Mountbatten had been to. Certainly the acceleration of
Britain's peaceful withdrawal from Africa stands as Macleod's greatest political achievement, securing his reputation as
'perhaps second only to Joseph Chamberlain' (DNB) among the reforming colonial secretaries.

Cyprus & the Mediterranean
The British hoped that Cyprus would remain as a British base in the eastern Mediterranean to ensure
that it maintained its dominance in the Middle East.
The island was divided demographically between the Greek majority (c. 80%) and a Turkish minority.
The Greek population wanted union with Greece while the Turkish minority were opposed to this.
Greek Cypriots, led by Archbishop Makarios, pressed for independence and formed a guerrilla
organisation (EOKA) which waged a terrorist campaign in which 200 people were killed. Britain
decared a state of emergency and 25,000 troops were sent to restore order in Cyprus.
‘Black October’ in 1958 saw 45 people killed and 2,000 EOKA suspects were arrested. Macmillan,
realising that the island could not be held indefinitely through force, opened talks with Makarios which
arrived at the following agreements:
•
•
•

Cyprus was to become an independent state within the Commonwealth by 1960
Its Greek and Turkish communities would each have a wide degree of autonomy
Britain retained sovereignty over two military bases: Dhekelia and Akrotiri

Civil war continued between the Greek and Turkish communities and the island remains partitioned
to this day.

The importance of Malta decreased as British naval power in the Mediterranean declined. A
referendum in 1956 saw a majority of the population vote for full integration with the United Kingdom.
However, this was rejected by the British Government and Malta became an independent state in
1963.
Despite Spanish claims to Gibraltar, the Gibraltarians firmly wanted to stay British. It remains a British
possession to this day.

West Indies
After the abolition of slavery and with the
introduction of free trade, Britain’s colonies in the
Caribbean had become and economic backwater
and remained so throughout the 19th century.
Between 1848 and 1910 the number of plantations
in Jamaica had shrunk from 513 to 77. The majority
black population remained desperately poor with
high rates of illiteracy. By 1900 Britain had reimposed direct rule to avoid power being hoarded by unrepresentative white assemblies.
West Indian nationalism was born during the miseries of the Great Depression in the 1930s which hit
the colonies hard; trade unions and other representative bodies were formed to campaign for reform.
Some reform did come during World War Two when the West Indies proved their loyalty through
supply of troops, and their strategic importance during the Battle of the Atlantic. Development grants
were given out by London and the franchise was expanded. The United States of America, however,
was clearly the dominant regional power and its economic, military and diplomatic interests were an
overbearing presence in the Caribbean.
Both the British and nationalists favoured the idea of a West Indian Federation that would be strong
enough to stand by itself as an independent dominion, and strengthen the bonds between the
different colonies.
In 1958 the West Indian Federation was formed, combining ten islands in a new state, with the British
retaining control of foreign affairs. However, the two largest islands, Jamaica and Trinidad, chafed at
the limitations this arrangement placed on their autonomy. Jamaica voted to quit in a 1961
referendum and by 1962 the Federation had completely collapsed.
After the Cuban Revolution of 1958, the United States became even more determined to assert its
interests in the region and it replaced Britain as the dominant power there, invading Grenada in 1983
to install a puppet government there and forestall the supposed spread of communism. The British
were not even consulted on this American aggression against a Commonwealth state and this revealed
starkly how imbalanced the ‘special relationship’ had become.

The spread of nationalism
Nationalism in Britain’s African possessions appeared as a major force only after 1945. While there
were some disturbances in the inter-war period (strikes by railway workers in Sierra Leone in 1919
and 1926 and disturbances in Kenya and Northern Rhodesia), the ‘organisation of discontent in Africa
was…very embryonic [and] easily suppressed.’22 However, the Second World War stirred up
discontent in the colonies and, shortly after the war had ended, there were serious disturbances in
Nigeria, Sudan and the Gold Coast. It is, therefore, possible to view nationalism’s post-war appearance
in Africa as precipitating Britain’s withdrawal from the continent.
As the 1950s progressed, formal movements began to develop; African nationalists looked to India as
their model, were encouraged by similar nationalist movements in neighbouring French colonies, and
often found support both amongst the Left within Britain and in the leadership of the now influential
USSR. 23 Charismatic individuals such as Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta emerged as leaders of
powerful movements. Moreover, Britain’s attempts to stimulate economic development in its African
colonies through investment in the 1950s stirred up local resentments even further; whereas British
rule had previously been fairly light-touch, when it started to become more active in the 1950s it lost
the support of former collaborators and upset local vested interests thus creating opposition for
itself.24 Thus, enthusiastic attempts at development such as the measures to eradicate ‘swollen shoot’
disease in the Gold Coast, the imposition of contour terracing into Kenya and the catastrophic
Groundnuts Scheme in Tanganyika made British rule much more apparent and much more deeply
resented.
Coupled with this, the introduction of representative forms of local government both antagonised the
indigenous elites through which the British had ruled indirectly and presented opportunities for local
nationalist politicians to gain political experience. As Bernard Porter has argued, the increasing
industrialisation and urbanisation of the 1950s created new opportunities for political development
and the exchange of ideas.25 Throughout the 1950s Britain faced growing violence and unrest in most
of its African colonies from Nigeria, to Kenya, to the different segments of the abortive Central African
Federation. In all of these places Britain’s own actions tended to exacerbate the problem. Elsewhere
in the Empire too, the British struggled in the 1950s with colonial unrest: EOKA violence in Cyprus and
a communist insurgency in Malaya stand out as notable examples. By the mid-1960s, as European
flags were lowered throughout Africa and the rest of the Third World, it seemed that nationalists
everywhere had triumphed over the old European Empires.
However, the role that nationalists played in ending the British Empire needs to be qualified; viewing
the process of decolonisation as a culmination of a long struggle for liberty by the oppressed nations
of the world seems a little misty-eyed and suspiciously Whiggish. Firstly, it is a mistake to assume that,
until nationalist movements appeared in the Twentieth Century, the British Empire was perpetually
calm and peaceful. It was not. For example, between the 1857 Mutiny and independence the British
faced 77 rebellions of varying seriousness that were distinct from Congress’ ‘nationalist’ activities. 26

The British had faced threats throughout the history of their imperial escapades and, after the
experience of losing the 13 American colonies, had found imaginative ways of coping and dealing with
them. Therefore, while the challenge presented by the movements of the mid-Twentieth Century
were, on the whole, more united and more widespread than other rebellious groups had been in the
past, it is nonetheless clear that, in few places, were the British simply chased out by a ‘nationalist’
movement. Simply because nationalist movements appeared in most British possessions prior to
independence, this did not mean that they were solely responsible for independence.
Upon closer inspection, it seems clear that the British dealt with ‘nationalists’ in different ways
depending on the circumstances. It is important to remember that nearly every movement was a
shaky coalition of different interests which made them weaker than they might, at first glance, appear.
As a result of conflict over what actually constituted ‘the nation’ and, therefore, what was being fought
for, Britain was given quite a lot of room for manoeuvre. Sometimes they would react with coercion:
the legal and military action against the Congress in India between the wars, against the Mau Mau in
Kenya and the communists in Malaya in the 1950s would be examples of this; at the time, the victory
of any of these groups could not be countenanced. In these instances, just as when it had faced
rebellions in the past, the British were largely successful in their suppression and it must be
remembered that Britain retained a formidable military power throughout the period of
decolonisation. However, the British chose not to keep hold of their empire by force and dealt with
many nationalist and anti-colonial movements in other ways.
By granting formal independence, the British hoped to placate nationalist demands while retaining
informal influence over the nationalist elite.27 The handing of power to nationalists can, therefore, be
seen as part of an enduring characteristic of British rule: the British had frequently opted to control
their empire through collaboration with indigenous elites and the British seem to have approached
nationalists with a similar attitude. There was to be a new arrangement which would appease
nationalist sentiments and centre on the Commonwealth: an organisation which the British believed
held a great deal of potential for advancing British interests in nominally independent states. In many
instances, the British willingly courted nationalists as potential new collaborators through whom they
could continue to wield influence and this was the hope in the Middle East, India and in Africa. The
British even went to the extent of cultivating nationalism in certain places and acting as its midwife so
that the British would have a group to hand over a fractured, heterogeneous territory to (Nigeria being
an obvious example).28 As Frederick Cooper has pointed out, the new ‘national imaginaries were as
much a consequence as a prior condition’ of independence.29 Therefore, rather than accrediting
nationalism with the sole responsibility of destroying Britain’s imperial position, it must be recognised
that their apparent success was only enabled by a range of other complimentary factors.

What explains the growth of nationalism in Africa in the 1950s and 1960s?

There emerged a new style of African leadership in the east of the continent after 1945. The first stage
began soon after the war when the earlier leadership of illiterate workers was replaced by younger,
more educated men in the cities, such as Mombasa and Nairobi. A similar change followed more slowly
in the rural areas, where the chiefs lost out to a newer, younger generation of leaders: the school
teachers, the clerks and the traders who were outside the traditional authority structure. The second
stage occurred in the 1950s, with the appearance of a new type of politician, the nationalist, with a
strong, more specific anti-colonial commitment. Many still in their twenties, they were better
educated than the earlier leaders. Some had been abroad for part of their education. The majority of
these new leaders were the second generation of the emergent elite: teachers, cooperative officials,
trade unionists, clerks, and some professional men. These were the men who built the political parties;
who edited the party newspapers; and who moulded rural and urban discontent into a base from
which they demanded power.

The Mau Mau was a nationalist, anti-colonial peasant movement. In Mau Mau there were no
revolutionary intellectuals. As a result, the Mau Mau lacked the focus and discipline of a revolutionary
party. In the Mau Mau revolt, there was a direct challenge to the social order, which was colonial and
racist. To this end, it could be argued that Mau Mau agitated for the abolition of the colonial system.
The revolt strove for an independent future free of colonial control. Yet most of the participants were
peasants who wanted their own land to live on and farm and who wanted to enjoy prosperity. But to
strive for an independent future did not necessarily mean that Mau Mau activists had a common
concrete idea as to the shape of this future. This remained one of their major weaknesses.

What does Maloba argue about the Mau Mau uprising?

~ 129 ~

Among the many intriguing aspects of Mau Mau is the length of time that the freedom fighters
survived in the thick forest environment of Mount Kenya and the Nyandarua range. Without prior
preparations or established arrangements for the supply of provisions, ammunition and firearms,
thousands of discontented Kikuyu, Embu and Meru peasants trekked to the forests to strengthen the
swelling numbers of Mau Mau freedom fighters. Faced with the sophisticated weapons of the British
and loyalist troops, the freedom fighters’ only advantage was the forest environment. Mau Mau was
a traumatic experience for both the British and the Africans. Among the peasants it precipitated many
hardships, including thousands of deaths, loss of property and indeterminate stretches of detention
and imprisonment. The Mau Mau struggle proved far more difficult to quell than the colonial
government had anticipated. What had initially appeared as a localised uprising became a fullyfledged war that lasted over three years and necessitated the importation of British troops, advanced
artillery and an extensive expenditure from the British treasury. The war rocked the very foundations
of the colonial regime in Kenya and forced British colonial officials and Whitehall and to rethinking the
whole colonial policy. In other words, Britain was awakened to the urgency of bringing Africans into
the mainstream of the country’s economic and political developments.

Southern Africa and Rhodesia
•

Read: pp. 238-240 in AQA

In southern-central Africa the situation was complicated by the demographics of the colonies there:
-

Northern Rhodesia (70,000 white people; 2 million Africans)
Southern Rhodesia (221,000 white people; 3.5 million Africans)
Nyasaland (7,000 white people; 2.5 million Africans)

The British government found themselves stuck between two pressures. The white settlers had hoped
to create a new dominion and resisted any attempts to limit their rights of self-government, or
introduce black majority rule. On the other hand, the British government was determined not to resist
the pressures from African nationalism and sought to introduce more representative forms of
government for the indigenous population.

Northern Rhodesia was a significant source of copper, while Southern Rhodesia was largely
agricultural. There were extremes of wealth with the majority of the black population earning less
than a tenth of the white population.
The Central African Federation was established in 1953, incorporating Northern and Southern
Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The British hoped to accommodate continuing white demands for autonomy
(essentially white minority rule) with growing African demands for self-government.
However, growing nationalism was getting out of control in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland
amongst black Africans opposed to the Federation and the privileges it gave to the white community.
Kenneth Kaunda in Northern Rhodesia and Dr Hastings Banda in Nyasaland led resistance to the
Federation. Developing violence in Nyasaland led to a declaration of a state of emergency in 1959 and
the arrest of Banda. Over 1300 Africans were arrested without trial and 20 people lost their lives in
the Nkata Bay incident.

~ 133 ~

The Devlin Report concluded that the Emergency had been an overreaction and condemned police
brutality. The Report also made it clear that the black population were completely opposed to the
Federation. This came at the same time as the report into the Hola Camp in Kenya and encouraged
moral arguments in favour of decolonisation which encouraged Macmillan and Macleod to push
ahead with further change.
Fearing that the situation might spiral out of control, Macmillan’s government established the
Monckton Commission which reported in October 1960 that the Federation in its present form was
unworkable and that greater representation for the black population was needed immediately.
Resistance from the white population and further violence from the black population in Northern
Rhodesia led to a breakdown in negotiations. The British Government accepted that the Federation
had no future. Final negotiations at Victoria Falls in 1963-64 resulted in the following outcomes:
•
•

Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia in 1964, with Kaunda as leader.
It remained within the Commonwealth.
Nyasaland became the independent state of Malawi in 1964, with Banda as leader. It also
remained within the Commonwealth.

This left the even more problematic issue of
Southern Rhodesia where the larger white
minority continued to resist any moves towards
black majority rule. A hard-line white movement,
the Rhodesian Front (RF), led by Ian Smith,
emerged to fight any power-sharing with the
black majority.
To forestall any further pressure from Britain, Ian
Smith, as Prime Minister of what was now simply
called ‘Rhodesia’, declared UDI from Britain in
1965 – a Unilateral Declaration of Independence
(right). Although this was illegal and condemned by Britain and other Commonwealth countries, there
was little Britain could do; Rhodesia had its own army and was supported by apartheid South Africa
who were sympathetic to the idea of a racially divided state.
A civil war in Rhodesia dragged on for fifteen years between the white government and the nationalist
ZANU and ZAPU movements. Eventually negotiations in London led to the establishment of black
majority rule and the creation of the state of Zimbabwe in 1980.

South Africa, 1945-1994
White South Africans had been split over the
question of South African entry into the
Second World War. Although South Africa
would join Britain, many Afrikaners remained
bitter about this and, in 1948, the Afrikaner
National Party won the election.
The National Party was determined to remove
British influence from South Africa and its
primary policy was the establishment of
apartheid: an institutionalised form of racial
segregation that denied legal and civil rights to the majority black population. Under apartheid white
South Africans enjoyed very high standards of living while their black neighbours suffered enormous
educational and economic disadvantage. Britain was critical of this policy (see Macmillan’s ‘winds of
change’ speech in Cape Town in 1960), but this had little impact on white South African opinion.
In 1961 after a whites-only referendum, South Africa became a republic and was pressured to leave
the Commonwealth. Over the following thirty years, South Africa would become increasingly isolated;
it was criticised by both sides during the Cold War and developed its own nuclear weapons to defend
itself. As internal opposition to apartheid increased from the black population, the South African
government became increasingly draconian and brutal in its crackdown on dissent.
The African National Congress emerged as the main organisation opposed to apartheid using violent
and non-violent tactics. Its most prominent leader was Nelson Mandela who was arrested and
imprisoned for sabotage in 1962.
Apartheid finally came to an end in the late 1980s and early 1990s with negotiations between the ANC
and the leaders of the National
Party who had come to the
conclusion that the growing
internal violence and international
opprobrium were unsustainable.
After 27 years in prison, Mandela
was released and was elected
President in South Africa’s first fully
democratic election in 1994. South
Africa was invited to re-join the
Commonwealth in the same year.

John Darwin, Unfinished Empire
For Macmillan especially, the Nyasaland crisis [1959] contained an implacable message. Henceforth
no British government should find itself dragged into confronting African popular movements. The
potential humiliation outweighed any imaginable gain. At all costs London must find representative
Africans with whom it could deal and to whom more power could be granted. In the famous speech
that marked the climax of his African tour in early 1960, Macmillan lectured the South African
parliament with the passion of a convert. ‘The wind of change is blowing through this continent… and
whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.’…
Between Macmillan’s ‘wind of change’ speech and the Federation’s demise [eventually in 1963], the
African scene had radically changed. One sign of this (and an embarrassment to the British) was De
Gaulle’s sudden offer of independence to France’s African colonies in 1960 (although not yet to
Algeria). Much more significant was the ‘Congo Disaster’. The Belgians had rushed their vast colony
into independence in January 1960, perhaps in the hope that they could then safely install a client
regime. The result was catastrophe. The copper-rich province of Katanga quickly split off, with the
open encouragement of Belgian mining interests. Rule from the centre broke down elsewhere. The
Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba was kidnapped and murdered with Belgian and perhaps American
connivance. Meanwhile the local Congolese army or force publique broke out in a mutiny, killing
dozens of whites, including women and children. A torrent of white refugees poured down through
the white-ruled Federation towards the South African ports and the safety of home. As the Congo split
up into rival regional satrapies, the Soviet Union began (just as Macmillan had warned) to appeal to
African nationalists, denouncing Western intrigue and blaming capitalist greed for the Congo’s fate.
There can be little doubt that the long-drawn out horror of the Congo concentrated British minds. It
strengthened still further the aversion they felt for being trapped in an African conflict. ‘The Prime
Minister and Colonial Secretary then said they did not want an Algeria’, noted Macmillan’s private
secretary in November 1960. The Congo was worse – because it was much nearer to Britain’s
remaining possessions in Central and East Africa. It also heightened the fear that the siren call from
Moscow would become more seductive with every month that passed until independence was
granted. Tanganyika and Uganda, both Congo neighbours, were rushed into sovereignty in 1961 and
1962. The same effects can be seen in the other difficult case: the settler colony of Kenya.

Changing Attitudes within Britain
•

Read: chapter 23 in AQA; pp. 588-606 in James

There are grounds for doubting whether nationalism, however powerful and decisive it may have been
in certain cases, really was the crucial determining factor in accelerating imperial retreat generally.
The growth of nationalism alone was never the whole story. An alternative way of explaining imperial
retreat has been to see it as a political choice taken by post-war governments under the pressure of
domestic (often economic) constraints and calculations of national interest. In this sense Britain simply
drifted away from her old imperial role; the ‘will to rule’ gradually slackened and public indifference
reinforced the effects of economic decline. The idea that during the 1940s and 1950s there was a
sharp change of attitude in Britain towards empire and the burdens of an imperial role, and that this
played a key part in disengagement from colonial responsibilities, helps to explain the end of the
British Empire.
-

Adapted from Decolonisation since 1945 by John Springhall (2001)

Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments in this
extract are in relation to British decolonisation between 1945 and 1967.

An assessment of the British mind-set and the metropolitan situation (in addition to the periphery) is
essential to understanding why the British Empire disintegrated. Certainly the desire for great-power
status never left British governments and the almost universal support behind the expedition to
recover the Falkland Islands in 1982 suggests that the British public never lost their appetite for
imperial adventures. While neither the Labour nor Conservative Parties were resolutely pro-Empire
(although the Conservatives in particular contained a faction that were), neither were they particularly
anti-Empire either and governments of either complexion consistently pursued policies which
attempted to defend Britain’s interests.30 The military intervention in Egypt in 1956 would be an
example of this. Indeed, even after the debacle of Suez there was an expectation that Britain’s place
in the world could be maintained and the aforementioned efforts to develop the African colonies in
the 1950s reveals that not everyone had given up on the idea of empire either.
However, the hope for many was that British power would be preserved through the Commonwealth.
The overriding concern of the British when dealing with nationalists was to ensure that a ‘friendly’
government remained in place so that vital British interests could be protected and influence retained.
The long tradition of meeting colonial discontent with reforms (dating back to the granting of
dominion status to the ‘white’ settler colonies – Canada, for instance, achieving virtual selfgovernment in 1867) gave many an acceptable political (and mental) framework in which to fit Indian
and other colonies’ moves towards responsible government. Indeed, for some, the development of
30

Smith, ‘French and British Decolonisation’, p. 78

~ 138 ~

colonies until they were ‘ready’ for self-government was the very raison d’etre of the Empire and this
seemed to give decolonisation the appearance of an inevitable, even welcome, process.31
In addition to this, the British public can be seen as either ambivalent about the whole imperial project
or, more pragmatically, more concerned about the economic costs of empire when the improvement
of living standards and the development of the welfare state seemed more of a priority. The fact that,
according to a survey in 1948, half the British population were unable to name even a single colony is
particularly revealing.32 Moreover, there was also an enduring strand of British political thinking which
had always put itself in direct opposition to the whole concept of Empire. Many Whigs had supported
the American revolutionaries in the 1770s and William Gladstone has been described as a ‘reluctant
imperialist’ who always had moral qualms about the imperial concept. 33 Opposition to the colonial
system was taken up as a cause by many in the Labour Party in the early 20th century and this moral
repugnance that some Britons felt towards the Empire became much more widespread in the
aftermath of the struggle against Nazism; the concepts of racial superiority which underlay
imperialism became deeply unfashionable in the post-war world. The hostility towards the
government in response to brutal treatment of the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya can be seen as an
example of this. Indeed, it is possible to discern a potentially fatal contradiction existing within Britain
which saw itself both as a bastion of human liberty since the 17th century, and yet also the governor
of an empire, the continuance of which entailed the restriction of liberty for its subject peoples. 34
Certainly, apart from a few dusty corners of the Conservative Party, there were few in Britain who dug
in their heels over the process of decolonisation.
It must be said, therefore, that the reason the British had a less traumatic experience of decolonisation
than the French, for instance (whose Fourth Republic collapsed in 1958 as a direct consequence of the
Algerian war) was, to an extent, because the British were reconciled to the ending of their Empire.35
While it is disingenuous to claim that the Empire was wound up purely because of apathy, moral
outrage or because it had finally achieved some supreme purpose, these factors certainly made the
transition easier for the British, particularly as there was a belief that influence could be preserved
and that the loss of empire didn’t necessarily mean a loss of status. To a significant extent, nationalist
or anti-colonial movements in the colonies were pushing at an already opening door.

Cultural Change:
As well as the geopolitical and economic change that encouraged decolonisation, British culture in
the 1950s and 1960s underwent profound changes:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The impact of the Suez Crisis (1956) and the Profumo Scandal (1963)
Demise of deference – the ‘Angry Young Men’ of the 1950s – John Osborne’s Look Back in
Anger (1956)
Relaxation of traditional social attitudes – Lady Chatterley’s Lover trial – 1960
The growth of satire – e.g. That Was the Week That Was (1962-3); Beyond the Fringe (1960);
Private Eye (1961)
Social mobility – attacks on class division
The emergence of the ‘teenager’ and youth culture – Beatles’ first LP - 1963

What then happened to those values, such as ‘duty’, ‘loyalty’, ‘hierarchy’, and ‘authority’, previously
considered to be the social bedrock of empire, yet now increasingly called into question? It is tempting
to link the erosion of these values to the process of decolonisation. After all, within scarcely a
generation the whole hierarchical embrace of empire had been dismantled, such that the British
aristocracy could no longer credibly claim to be the national and imperial ruling class by hereditary
right. It could be argued that Suez changed attitudes towards military authority, ushering in a
willingness to challenge old, deferential values. Among those who felt that Suez epitomised what was
wrong with post-war Britain were the ‘Angry Young Men’ of the post-war era. Most famously, John
Osborne and Alan Sillitoe captured the pessimism and disillusionment of the late 1950s and early
1960s., and especially the lack of opportunities for the working class. For both men, Suez provided a
licence to rail against the arrogance and ineptitude of Britain’s ruling class.

Excerpt from ‘Look Back in Anger’ by John Osborne
‘Look Back in Anger’ is a seminal play that was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in
1956 (the year of the Suez Crisis). Its realism and focus on ordinary life meant that it was an abrupt
change from most earlier plays; the opening night’s crowd gasped when the curtain rose to reveal the
set: a cramped, dreary one-room flat in the Midlands, with an ironing board as the most prominent
feature. The play helped generate the term ‘angry young men’ to describe the mood of a new
generation.
The play’s focus is a young married couple, living in the aforesaid claustrophobic flat. Jimmy Porter is
an educated man with a working class background. He is angry and bitter at the rest of the world, and
particularly the upper classes of Britain of whom Jimmy regards his wife, Alison, as representative.
Their relationship is essentially abusive as Jimmy vents his frustration on Alison. In this scene, Alison’s
father, a former Colonel from the Indian Army, arrives to take her back home.

COLONEL: I am mystified. Your husband has obviously taught you a great deal, whether you realise it
or not. What any of it means, I don’t know. I always believed that people married each other because
they were in love. That always seemed a good enough reason to me. But apparently that’s too simple
for young people nowadays. They have to talk about challenges and revenge. I just can’t believe that
love between men and women is really like that.
ALISON: Only some men and women.
COLONEL: But why you? My daughter… No. Perhaps Jimmy is right. Perhaps I am a – what was it? an
old plant left over from the Edwardian Wilderness. And I can’t understand why the sun isn’t shining
any more. You can see what he means, can’t you? It was March, 1914, when I left England, and, apart
from leaves every ten years or so, I didn’t see much of my own country until we all came back in ’47.
Oh, I knew things had changed, of course. People told you all the time the way it was going – going to
the dogs, as the Blimps are supposed to say. But it seemed very unreal to me, out there. The England
I remembered was the one I left in 1914, and I was happy to go on remembering it that way. Beside, I
had the Maharajah’s army to command – that was my world and I loved it, all of it. At the time, it
looked like going on forever. When I think of it now, it seems like a dream. If only it could have gone
on forever. Those long, cool evenings up in the hills, everything purple and golden. Your mother and I
were so happy then. It seemed as though we had everything we could ever want. I think the last day
the sun shone was when that dirty little train steamed out of that crowded, suffocating Indian station,
and the battalion band playing for all it was worth. I knew in my heart it was all over. Everything.
ALISON: You’re hurt because everything has changed. Jimmy is hurt because everything is the same.
And neither of you can face it. Something’s gone wrong somewhere, hasn’t it?
COLONEL: It looks like it my dear.

Withdrawal from East of Suez
In 1964, the Conservatives lost the general election to
Harold Wilson’s Labour Party. Wilson tried to project an
image of modernity and spoke of the ‘white heat’ of
technology driving a forward-looking economy and
society. There was no room for empire anymore and he
continued Macleod’s policy of rapid decolonisation.
In November 1967 the value of sterling came under
pressure, forcing Britain to devalue the pound by 15%.
The new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Roy Jenkins, was
an ardent supporter of the European Community and an
opponent of Britain’s over-extended global
commitments.
In January 1968 Harold Wilson announced to the House of Commons that, due to financial constraints
and budget cuts, Britain was withdrawing all significant forces from east of Suez – Britain would no
longer be a power in the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, and the Far East. For the foreseeable future,
Britain’s defence commitments would be focused on Europe and the Mediterranean.
In his statement announcing this to the House of Commons, Wilson referenced the appropriateness
of Rudyard Kipling’s poem, Recessional.
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The Captains and the Kings depart…
Far-called our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

Philip Larkin, ‘Homage to a Government’, 10th of January 1969

Next year we are to bring the soldiers home
For lack of money, and it is all right.
Places they guarded, or kept orderly,
must guard themselves, and keep themselves orderly.
We want the money for ourselves at home
Instead of working. And this is all right.

It's hard to say who wanted it to happen,
But now it's been decided nobody minds.
The places are a long way off, not here,
Which is all right, and from what we hear
the soldiers there only made trouble happen.
Next year we shall be easier in our minds.

Next year we shall be in a country
That brought its soldiers home for lack of money.
The statues will be standing in the same
Tree-muffled squares, and look nearly the same.
Our children will not know it's a different country.
All we can hope to leave them now is money.

Ronald Hyam, Britain’s Declining Empire (Cambridge; 2007)
Our understanding of decolonisation can be usefully deepened by
reference to the opinions of the officials. Civil servants were uniquely
well placed by their experience and access to information to grasp the
dynamics of what was happening, at least in terms of the immediate
reasons and context for decisions taken. The reasons they gave for
the speeding up of the process were always about external influences,
usually nationalist, but also, in later phases, international pressure.
Saville Garner believed that the British empire came to an end
'because other people's empires were crumbling all around'.
In the final analysis, centre and periphery were equally important. The
metropolitan side, with the decision-making power, was the one
which holds the explanatory key. Colonies which demanded selfgovernment usually got it, but we cannot say that they thereby
determined the outcome. The really significant historical question to ask is how the imperial power
had got psychologically to the point where it was prepared to open the door to self-rule when
nationalist leaders knocked and asked. By the mid-1950s, Lennox-Boyd, the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, on a number of occasions was told privately by colonial politicians not to take their public
requests too seriously; they had, they explained, to make demands in order to keep their local support,
but they realised that they needed more time and to be better prepared.
The Labour government theory of the late 1940s was that prestige would be more likely to accrue by
timely transfers of power to moderate nationalists; Attlee and his ministers accepted the Colonial
Office proposition that 'the transfer of power is not a sign of weakness, but it is, in fact, a sign and
source of strength'. In any case they did not want to be found in the last colonial ditch, vilified
internationally along with the bad guys like the Portuguese. Britain did not take the initiative in the
decolonisation of Africa. Great power rivalry - in the shape of the Cold War and a competition for
international respectability -induced the British twentieth-century scramble to get out of Africa.
The British empire flourished and declined in a particular set of international contexts. The way it
operated depended not only on favourable external and geopolitical circumstances, but also on the
feasibility of imperial control, in terms both of the acquiescence of peoples ruled, and of the ability to
match available resources to the maintenance and defence of a far-flung system. All these
preconditions were under threat in the period after 1918. Although the empire was impressively
mobilised on behalf of the British war effort after 1939, the overall trend towards an increasingly
unmanageable and dysfunctional imperial system was not reversed. What happened in the
international sphere after the Second World War gradually but decisively reinforced the sense that a
global empire was not only beyond Britain's means, but was also threatening its prestige and
reputation, and becoming a liability.
The Cold War determined the main outlines of British policy. Because of it, Britain had to satisfy the
nationalists, side with the USA, strengthen the Commonwealth and square the United Nations.
Because of it, the whole thrust of decolonisation was to proceed in such a way as to encourage the
emergence of pro-Western nationalist states. What the British people really cared about in the twenty
years after the end of the Second World War was not the future of the empire, but how to avert the

~ 147 ~

probability of what Hugh Dalton called 'the Third World War'. The words of Clement Attlee have an
insistent resonance: 'An attempt to maintain the old colonialism would, I am sure, have immensely
aided communism.'

❖ What does Hyam argue about British decolonisation?

The immediate causes of the end of the British Empire are to be found not only in the nationalist
movements in the Empire itself, but also in the lessons learned from the Algerian revolution and in
the danger of Soviet intervention in the Congo. It seemed altogether more prudent to settle with
African liberation movements in eastern and central Africa before war broke out between blacks and
whites or before the Africans turned to the Russians for sponsorship… If the Americans looked forward
to transforming the Empire in the long run into independent states within the Western alliance, in the
short run they propped it up against the challenge posed by the Soviet Union and Communist China.
Paradoxically, one consequence was that the Cold War sometimes presented nationalists with the
opportunity of playing the superpowers against each other or against the British. Actual or prospective
superpower intervention could increase nationalist prospects… The international climate thus
expedited the advance to independence, but the circumstances varied from region to region, from
colony to colony. With the United States and the Soviet Union competing against each other in the
colonial world, the local strength of nationalism or insurgency often determined the actual timing of
decolonisation.

~ 148 ~

The rapidity with which decolonisation occurred between 1945 and 1967 suggests that while
decolonisation was the product of changes at the international, domestic British and colonial levels, it
was the international ones – particularly the Second World War – that triggered further changes that
destroyed the old pre-war relationships of the imperial powers with their empires. In the British case,
involvement in the war drove them to changes in colonial policy that created new political conditions
which made the colonies harder to rule. Meanwhile the international and domestic British side effects
of the war (especially the emergence of the anti-colonial powers, the USA and the Soviet Union)
encouraged colonial resistance to the old colonial powers. It made it harder for the British to reassert
authority without imposing unwelcome financial and political burdens on the home government, as
well as jeopardising wider international interests outside the Empire. A ‘vicious circle’ of imperial
decline was set in motion, and the imperial system unravelled.
-

Adapted from Britain and Decolonisation by John Darwin (1988)

It would be a mistake to think that the European powers gave independence to their colonies after
the Second World War. There were certainly international pressures which helped bring about
decolonisation, as well as domestic considerations within the imperial nations. But independence was
wrested from the grasp of the imperialists – not freely surrendered. It was the nationalists who held
the whip hand for once – not the imperialists. The winning of independence by the former colonies
was in a very large measure the work of the nationalists in the colonies themselves. Their ‘positive
action’ and agitation, including in some instances armed insurrection, gradually made it clear to the
colonial powers that, in the existing state of world opinion, it was not worth their while to attempt to
hold the colony by force and that it was better to retreat with the best face possible, salvaging what
they could and trying to retain as much good will as possible for the post-independence era.
-

Adapted from The Rise and Fall of Western Colonialism by Stewart C Easton (1964)

The significance of nationalist movements in bringing about the end of empire can be questioned.
Until local crises blew up, policy towards specific colonies was mainly determined by Britain’s
economic and national needs, while plans for individual territories were shaped by reasoned
assessments for the security, economic viability, social cohesion, and political maturity of each.
Increasingly, however, events forced the British to compromise – ultimately to abandon – staged
progress, measured programmes and long-term planning. But even then the authorities were
influenced more by the dangers of lawlessness on a colony than by the force of the nationalists’
demands. Left to themselves, the British would probably have proceeded slowly – worrying about
whether colonies were important from a British point of view and setting a leisurely programme for
them to evolve towards independence. But outbreaks of violence and disorder increasingly forced the
pace. In general violence was not deliberately instigated by the nationalists. But nationalist
movements did benefit from unrest since the British did not want to hold out for long against violence.

Nationalist or anti-colonial movements rode the crest of a wave which they did little to initiate and
did not control. They were operating in an historical moment when the survival of Britain’s Empire
was impossible. Britain’s own political climate and its economic situation meant that the British
Empire was destined to wind up at some point and it was the geo-political situation that determined
when that point would be. This does not mean that nationalist movements played a negligible role in
explaining Britain’s imperial decline. Indeed, had this phenomenon not existed, Britain’s Empire might
have ended very differently and it was only because of their existence that the British had anyone to
hand over territory to. However, the British courted them as much as fought them and their apparent
success in achieving independence from Britain was crucially dependent on other interconnected
issues.

That India became a member of the Commonwealth was spun as the culmination of liberal empire,
another signal transition moment in its unfolding. There was no embarrassment in it. The post-war
Labour government was deeply committed to this narrative and its incorporation of the notion of
colonial development that the empire could produce commodities that would earn much needed
dollars. In 1960, while the former labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee extolled the empire for
voluntarily surrendering sovereignty to its colonies, the ruling Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, spun
the wind of change blowing through Africa as the fulfilment of the imperial narrative. Such narratives
of continuities with the past, real or imagined, framed understandings of decolonisation. The British
did not simply let go of empire after the Second World War whatever Attlee claimed. They fought long
and hard to hold on to some colonies, such as Kenya and Malaya. In others the promise of substantial
continuity allowed more graceful transition.

In the twenty years or so after the Second World War, Britain succeeded in disbanding her empire
with remarkable dignity and skill. She was known to have decided not to hang onto her colonies
forever – it had long been recognised that such a policy was both impracticable and undesirable.
Nationalist leaders understood that their real quarrel with Britain was over the timing of
independence rather than independence itself. This being the case, most quarrels concerned Britain’s
estimate of how ready native peoples were to govern themselves. British ministers wanted to hand
over power only when a sufficiently educated class was ready and able to administer their country.
Until they were convinced that one existed, they felt they would betray their responsibility to native
populations should they give up control too soon. Native leaders, on the other hand, pointed out this
was bound to take generations and Britain should give proof of her good intentions by bringing natives
into the government process.
Adapted from A Sked and C Cook, Post-War Britain, 1979
After the substantial decolonisation in Asia in the late 1940s, the American government became much
more concerned to keep its European allies devoted to the struggle against communism than to
suggest that they should give up any more colonies. Although this now allowed the British to maintain
their imperial position free from external pressure, the expenses of the campaigns in Kenya and
Malaya were uncomfortably high. Almost all of Britain’s colonies had been acquired at very little cost,
as the British were unwilling to take control if it involved heavy spending, and the cost of maintaining
law and order had been subsequently carried by the colonies themselves. However, the experience of
the early 1950s brought about a change, as British taxpayers suddenly had to meet the bulk of the
expense they could not afford. From this point onwards it was realised that, unless a larger proportion
of the national income than ever before were to be spent on colonial defence, a policy of withdrawal
would be unavoidable.
Adapted from T Lloyd, The British Empire 1558–1983, 1984
An enduring historical myth, repeated in a number of political memoirs, suggests that Britain excelled
in the practice of ‘managed decline’: sensibly reducing its imperial ambition in accordance with
shrinking resources. It was certainly true that the British were extremely reluctant to resist mass
political movements, whether in India after 1945 or in Africa after 1959. But they were much more
willing to use political force when the odds were more promising and the incentives greater, as in
Malaya and Kenya. Nor was it true that after the Second World War British leaders quickly adjusted
their vision of Britain’s place in the world to its reduced physical power and economic potential. For
over twenty years the reverse was the case. Even the supposed champion of realism, Harold
Macmillan, was anything but realistic. His grandiose schemes for preserving British world power
indicated almost no comprehension of the complex realities of African politics.

The devolution of colonial power, whether achieved by armed struggle or negotiation, was the result
of two complementary forces: increasingly popular anti imperialism which was articulate and often
threatening; and decreasing European means and will to power. Everywhere anti-imperialism formed
the basis of colonial nationalism. It gave political cohesion to diverse ethnic and social groups within
each colony; it provided for ideological unification and it explained in simple terms to the colonial
peoples their poverty and backwardness. Once the imperial jewels like India had demonstrated the
possibilities of anti-imperialist action, colonial politics elsewhere inclined more and more towards
future independence and nationhood. The political change was affected by two means: guerrilla war
(which was more the exception than the rule) and colonial party politics (an external appendage of
western liberal democracy). The chief agency of political change was negotiation between the colonial
administration and the emergent national political party. Thus, the British converted the most
vociferous national party into the majority party and its leader eventually became Prime Minister.

British migration in 1967

~ 154 ~

The word repeatedly used in the memoirs of the West Indian and African migrants who came to Britain
in the post war decades is ‘disappointed’. They were disappointed that the nation they had been told
was their mother country treated them so badly, disappointed that the skills and talents which the
nation had found useful during the war years were disregarded in peacetime and they were ushered
into low status or menial jobs. They were deeply disappointed and wounded when they discovered
how difficult it was to fulfil the most basic human need and find somewhere to live. Thousands of post
war black migrants were consigned to the poorest parts of Britain cities and there left prey to
predatory landlords such as West London's infamous Peter Rachman. The migrants would have felt an
even deeper sense of disappointment had they known the help that was offered to the European
voluntary workers and denied to them, and that behind closed doors successive governments had
plotted to portray them as indolent, immoral and backward. Many felt they had been lied to, not just
by prospective employers who had actively recruited in the West Indies, but by the British Empire.

What are the residual legacies of the empire for Britain?

~ 156 ~

Although the imperial message was still conveyed to Liverpool schools after 1945 through films and
lecturers sent by the Imperial Institute, and though though prizes were still awarded for essays on
imperial and Commonwealth themes, much of the impetus had waned by the mid-1950s. The 1953
coronation was effectively the last great imperial event in Liverpool. And amnesia about empire
seemed to set in. Even Labour, finally in control of the council in 1955, seems to have taken little
interest in imperial affairs. Its Toxteth branch passed no resolutions regarding colonies in the 1950s,
and woke up to events in Africa only with the Sharpeville massacre of March 1960. Nor did member
show interest in the conditions of Liverpool’s black community, itself a legacy of empire. It is therefore
tempting to accept the argument that imperial propaganda was generated by a few enthusiasts, and
appealed only to relatively few of the population.

Adapted from ‘Transmitting Ideas of Empire: Representations and Celebrations in
Liverpool, 1886-1953’ by Murray Steele (2008)

Over the course of the 1950s, understandings of decolonisation shifted, with continual news of the
Kenyan emergency and other conflicts and, more decisively, the humiliating British defeat that was
the Suez crisis of 1956: an abortive invasion of Egypt brought home the lesson that Britain could no
longer flex its military muscle without Americans say so, bringing down the government of Anthony
Eden. The narrative of decolonisation as a story of imperial fulfilment and continuity within the
Commonwealth was now challenged by the decline thesis of British history, a sense of history’s
betrayal of Britain. Rather than doing justice to Britain’s past, history seemed to be mocking it: what
future might they possess now? Old narratives of the rise and fall of empires were trotted out to
explain Britain’s post-war fortunes. The generation of would-be colonial administrators who emerged
from the public schools and Oxbridge encountered a new political reality and responded with anger
and, more productively, derision, launching a rich satire trend ridiculing well-worn ideas about duty
and service to nation and empire and the civilising mission.

Epilogue: End of Empire?
•

Read: pp. 622-639 in James

The withdrawal from Africa in the 1960s left only a few scattered remnants around the world, most
of which were too small to survive as independent states. Nevertheless, the last two decades of the
20th Century saw two final imperial moments:
The Falklands War
The British government had long wanted to withdraw from the
Falkland Islands, first acquired in the early 19th century. However,
the population of 3,500 British settlers there resisted attempts to
share sovereignty with Argentina which had long claimed the
islands they called the Malvinas. The regime in Buenos Aires was
a fascistic military dictatorship which sought to exploit the
grievance of the islands for popularity.
Talks between Argentina and the UK broke down in the early
1980s and Argentina invaded the islands in 1982, assuming that
Britain would not bother to fight for territory so far away. Fearing
damage to Britain’s international prestige at the height of the Cold
War, and framing the issue as one of self-determination, the Prime
Minister, Margaret Thatcher, ordered a naval task force to sail to
the South Atlantic to retake the territory. Meanwhile, the British tabloid press whipped up an
atmosphere of jingoism.
Despite enormous logistical difficulties, the British Armed Forces successfully defeated the
Argentinians and fought their way back on to the islands. British prestige had been reasserted and the
UK subsequently rebuilt a significant military force in the South Atlantic. Throughout the conflict
Britain was fortunate that it could rely on tacit support from Washington DC and the Presidency of
Ronald Reagan who was a close ally of Thatcher.
The conflict was reminiscent of the ‘small wars’ of the 19th century and demonstrated once again that,
when pushed, Britain could still assert itself as a formidable power able to project force around the
world.
Hong Kong
Hong Kong, which had been acquired from China during the
opium wars, was Britain’s final remaining colony of significant
size. It had developed into a financial and
trading entrepot in the Far East with a booming economy that
contrasted with the communist mainland. However, Britain’s
lease on the New Territories (the land bordering Hong Kong
which made the colony viable) was due to expire in 1997 and
Beijing were determined to regain control over Hong Kong.

~ 159 ~

The problem was that most of the Chinese residents of Hong Kong had no desire to become part of
communist China. In negotiations, Britain and China agreed a settlement in 1984; Hong Kong would
be handed over in 1997, but would retain its economic and political freedoms for a further 50 years –
the concept was named as ‘One Country; Two Systems’. The final governor, Chris Patten, tried to
entrench a democratic culture in the colony before a moving handover ceremony in 1997. As the
Union Jack was lowered over Britain’s final significant colony, Elgar’s Nimrod was played. Patten and
the Prince of Wales then sailed away from Hong Kong on the last voyage of HMY Britannia.
Return to east of Suez?
Yet, Britain remained a global power; a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a leading
member of NATO amongst other international organisations. Despite defence cuts after the end of
the Cold War, Britain embarked on a more global role again, particularly under the premiership of
Tony Blair from 1997 to 2007:
•

Leading NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999
Intervention in Sierra Leone, 2000
Invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, 2001 onwards (with the USA)
Invasion and occupation of Iraq, 2003 onwards
Intervention (with France) in the Libyan civil war, 2011

Britain’s Armed Forces remain some of the most powerful in the world, as indicated in the launch of
two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. Its ‘soft power’ reach is global, and it remains one of the
world’s largest economies, with London as the world’s financial hub. Britain spends $18.7 billion a year
in international development aid (second only to the United States). In 2018 Britain reopened a
permanent naval base east of Suez in Bahrain on the Persian Gulf, HMS Juffair.
