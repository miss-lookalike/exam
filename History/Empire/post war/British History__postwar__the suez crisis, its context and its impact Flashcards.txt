<br><br>
"
"What did the Suez crisis demonstrate to nationalists
<br><br>
"	"that if they pushed harder Britain could be forced to surrender which made it much harder to contain the movements
<br><br>

<br><br>
"

<br><br>

<br><br>
"

<br><br>
"	"'Suez had exposed the American essentials underlying British power for all to see'
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What impact did the Suez crisis have on defence
<br><br>
"	"After the loss of their dominance in the Middle East, defence reforms in 1957 reduced the scale of britain's armed forces and their commitments overseas, ended national service, and focused on the developments of britain's independent nuclear deterrent at the core of their country's defence. This curtailed their ability to intervene in future colonial disputes

<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What does a 1957 review state about decolonization
<br><br>

<br><br>
"	"that spending on colonial developments should actually be increased
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
"	"In the eastern Mediterranean: Malta remained British until 1964 and Cyprus remained britain's HQ in the eastern Mediterranean
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"In what regard did they actually remain committed to intervention in the Middle East (4 things)
<br><br>
"	"They intervened in Kuwait in 1961, they remained close to Jordan, they fought to maintain their position in Aden and only with drew in 1967 because of nationalist pressure and they did not pull forces from the Persian Gulf until 1971
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"In what regard was sue is not a turning point in decolonization
<br><br>
"	"Leading conservative ministers were already aware of the cost of the empire so rather than a turning point it was just an encouragement. The 1957 review of britain's defence policy started before suez
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
"	"After South Africa left the Commonwealth not in the immediate aftermath of the Suez crisis
<br><br>

"
"When were decisions to transfer power in Ghana and Malaya in 1957 made
<br><br>
"	"Before the Suez crisis
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"How did Suez ultimately impact their relationship with the USA
<br><br>
"	"although it had been a clear demonstration that Britain could not do anything without telling the USA, the USA still encouraged britain's imperial position when it was beneficial. they relied on Britain in the Far East and urged them to continue their colonial role in Hong Kong, and in 1961 the US aided Britain in Kuwait when they were threatened by Iraq
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What impact did the Suez crisis have on the British role in the Far East
<br><br>
"	"They still remained committed to its role in the Far East After 1956. The anglo malayan defence agreement of 1957 allowed continued stationing of British armed forces in the country and Singapore remained an important British overseas base. British power in the Far East had crumbled because of World War Two, not because of Suez
<br><br>

<br><br>
"
"What do Dimbleby and Reynolds say about the Suez crisis
<br><br>
"	"that suez was the turning point in exposing the global position of the empire but not necessarily the turning point in decolonization
<br><br>

<br><br>
"

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
"

<br><br>
