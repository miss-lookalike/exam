Mounting Pressure for Independence
* Post-1940s: Growing nationalist movements demand self-governance
* Ghana's independence in 1957 inspired Nigerian aspirations
* Key nationalist leaders: Nnamdi Azikiwe (NCNC), Obafemi Awolowo (AG), Ahmadu Bello (NPC)

Ethnic & Regional Tensions
* North (NPC): Conservative, favoured gradual transition
* South (NCNC & AG): Advocated for immediate independence
* 1953 crisis (Kano riots) exposed national divisions, pressuring the British to accelerate decolonisation

British Colonial Strategy
* Implemented constitutional reforms:
o Richards Constitution (1946) - Limited regional autonomy.
o Macpherson Constitution (1951) - Increased local governance but still under British control
o Lyttelton Constitution (1954) - Established federalism, granting greater autonomy to regions
* 1958 London Conference set October 1, 1960, as the date for independence

Key Events Leading to Independence
* 1953 Crisis: Demand for rapid self-rule led to riots, forcing British to rethink their approach
* 1954 Lyttelton Constitution: Established Nigeria as a federal state with regional self-rule
* 1957-1959: Eastern & Western regions gained self-governance (1957), followed by the North (1959)

Role of Political Parties
* Action Group (AG) - Led by Awolowo, strong push for rapid independence & social reforms.
* NCNC - Led by Azikiwe, promoted unity and nonviolent negotiation for self-rule.
* NPC - Led by Bello, favoured gradual transition to avoid northern marginalisation

British Motivations for Granting Independence
* Economic Interests: Britain wanted to maintain trade ties, especially in oil and agriculture
* Fear of Unrest: The 1953 riots and Ghana's independence (1957) increased pressure
* Strategic Exit: Avoiding costly conflicts like in Kenya & Malaya influenced a peaceful transition

Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe's Influence
* NCNC Leader: Advocated for a united Nigeria beyond ethnic lines
* Political Journalism: His newspaper, West African Pilot, mobilised nationalist sentiment
* Negotiator: Played a key role in the 1958 London Conference that finalised independence
* First President (1963): Worked to maintain national unity in post-independence Nigeria
