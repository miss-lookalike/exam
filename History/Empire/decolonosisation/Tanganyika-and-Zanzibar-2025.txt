Decolonisation in Tanganyika and Zanzibar

Tanganyika: Brief Overview

* 1920: Britain gain Tanganyika (formally German East Africa) as part of the Versailles Peace Settlement
* 1927: Colonial Secretary Leo Amery had desired the creation of an East African Federation, in which Britain's holdings there (inc. Tanganyika) would merge, with Rhodesia as its hegemon.
* WW2: Britain didn't enforce conscription upon Tanganyika, yet introduced quotas of volunteer soldiers. 
* 1947: Attempts at colonial development via the Groundnuts Scheme failed, costing £40mn and only providing 11,000 acres of tillable land.
* 1954: Formation of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), the first front to fight for Tanganyikan Independence
* 1958-9: Constitutional Reforms to allow greater African representation in government.
* 1958-60: Elections held: TANU win the majority of seats.
* 1961: Tanganyika granted formal independence.
* 1964: Zanzibar and Tanganyika unite to form 'Tanzania'.

Zanzibar: Brief Overview

* Zanzibar is a very diverse island, compromising of a majority African population, yet with a small Arab ruling class that were disproportionately dominant.
* 1890: Zanzibar becomes a formal protectorate under Britain
* 1950s: Emergence of rival nationalist parties: Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) and Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) set up to represent the respective interests of African Zanzibaris and the Arab ruling elite. Both desired independence, but with different systems of government
* December 1963: Parliament pass the Zanzibar Act, officially ending their protectorate status over the island. Zanzibar was to be an independent state within the Commonwealth ruled by a Constitutional Monarchy
* January 1964: A revolution was staged by the ASP, deposing Sultan Jamshid Bin Abdullah.
* A new Republic of Zanzibar was established under the Leadership of Abeid Karume, African dominant, with thousands of Arabs and South Asians forced into exile
* April 1964: Zanzibar merged with Tanganyika to create Tanzania. Karume would serve as Deputy PM to Mwalimu.

Economic Factors

* Tanganyika held no important economic value to Britain: It had some mineral resources, but these were by no means plentiful.
* Tanganyika had a relatively poor amount of tillable farmland: The failures of the 1947 Groundnuts Scheme (£40mn for 11,000 acres) proved the almost impossible task that would be making the Colony economically profitable via agriculture.
* Zanzibar held no direct economic value: The loss of India rendered its prior strategic importance to safeguard the East African Coast as void.

Politics within Britain

* 1957-63: Harold MacMillan led the Conservative Party as PM. MacMillan was a One Nation Conservative, who prioritised the continuation of the welfare state and domestic issues over the Empire.
* Tanganyika and Zanzibar, like many other colonies lacking in economic or strategic to Britain, was deemed surplus to requirements by the Conservative Government.
* MacMillan's Colonial Secretary, Iain Macleod, also corroborated this desire for decolonisation.

Nationalism

* 1954: Formation of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) by Julius Mwalimu Nyerere in order to unite the people in their demands for independence.
* Nyerere emphasised the need for national unity and peaceful protests: He was an immensely popular figure, who the British trusted to establish a strong and stable government that would remain within its sphere of influence (Tanzania is a member of the Commonwealth).
* Political Reforms between 1958-9 to allow greater African involvement in government helped in the creation of a stable long term framework for a post-Colonial State.
* 1958-1960 Elections: TANU won the majority of the seats, showing a large-scale public drive for independence.
* Zanzibar's political theatre was dominated by two nationalist parties (ASP and ZNP) who were both opposed to colonial rule despite other disagreements

Geopolitics

* The legitimacy of long term British rule in Tanganyika was questionable: It was initially a League of Nations Mandate and then a UN Trust Territory. British rule was always designed to be temporary.
* 1954: A UN mission to Tanganyika had concluded that a "timetable" of between 20-30 years be drawn up for independence. 
* The international community's feelings regarding colonialism were in full decline by the 1960s, with bodies such as the UN leading this charge.
