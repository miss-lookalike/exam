Ugandan Decolonisation
Context:

- Uganda had been a British protectorate since 1899
- Britain primarily governed through indirect rule for most of its time in power using local Kings/Chiefs
- Uganda was integrated into the world economy and used as a source of cotton, coffee and tea --> led to unrest amongst the population
What were the main parties involved in Ugandan Independence?
- Ugandan People's Congress (UPC) led by Miltan Obote, had strong widespread support particularly in rural areas and advocated for a united, independent Uganda.
- Democrat Party (DP) led by Benedicto Kiwanuka, wanted to keep catholic interests in Ugandan government 
- Ugandan National Congress (UNC) led by Ignatius Musaazi, UNC had limited influence outside of urban areas
- King Mutesa II of Buganda. Buganda is kingdom of Uganda and during British rule, it had significant autonomy special status leading to other kingdoms feeling marginalised. During independence talks, Mutesa II was keen to maintain Buganda's status whilst the central government wanted a unified state

How did Ugandan Independence Occur?
- Growing political awareness and dissatisfaction led to nationalist movements rising with the UNC forming in 1952, DP in 1954 and UPC in 1960.
- In 1955, British concessions occurred with the Lennox-Boyd constitution which allowed limited African representation in government
o Later in 1958, more seats were added but nationalist groups kept demanding greater representation which culminated in the 1961 Constitutional Conference held in London
- Obote (UPC) and Kiwanuka (DP) attended. Bugandan representatives were absent as they wanted special federal status or even separate independence from Uganda
- At the conference, it was agreed that Uganda was to become a constitutional monarchy, with Mutesa II as President and Obote the Prime Minister. Obote held the real power due to the nature of a constitutional monarchy, Mutesa II was simply a symbolic figure
o The Ugandan Independence Act of 1962 finalised the agreement and saw British exit from Uganda
- Ugandan politics saw great instability in the following years. In 1966, conflict broke out between the central government and Bugandans resulting in Mutesa II fleeing and Obote declaring Uganda a republic, abolishing the Bugandan kingdom. In 1971, whilst Obote was in Singapore for a Commonwealth conference, Idi Amin staged a military coup and seized control of the country. His regime was infamous for its brutality, mass killings and economic collapse. 

What were the main factors driving Ugandan Independence? 
1. Rising Nationalism. Ugandan's increasingly wanted self-rule and the formation of Ugandan nationalist parties with key figures gave the movement structure to achieve its conquest
2. General trends towards decolonisation post WW2. Ghanaian independence in 1957 started a domino effect. African independence elsewhere inspired nationalists in Uganda
3. UN pressure. By the late 1950s/early 1960s, the UN had made it clear that colonisation violated principles of self-rule and encouraged African decolonisation
4. British colonial policy. Uganda's economic importance had faded, and the costs of its administration kept increasing making Uganda less economically viable
