The Gold Coast

What was the context?

- In 1947 the Head of the Africa Department in the Colonial Office Andrew Cohen, described the Gold Coast as the most advanced African colony in terms of political maturity of its people and the ability to rule independently.
- The country also had a thriving economy based on cocoa, and best Western educated population in British Africa. It was also politically difficult with history of strikes on railways, mines and cocoa industry (Accra riots 28th Feb-16th March 1948- 27 killed + 237 injured). 1943 Colonial Office view was that independence would take several decades, despite the emergence of African Nationalist movements.
- British Colonial administrators anticipated during the war that the rise in educated African elite would mean allowing some degree of African political representation.
- Britain didn't want any change to be gradual and to not impair their economic and political interests. But the alarming disease 'swollen shoot' effecting cocoa trees accelerated unrest as compensation was inadequate. 
- Burns Constitution was drawn up in the Gold Coast in 1946. This established a Legislative Council of 12 British nominees and 18 elected African members. Despite this breakthrough, final power remained in the hands of the British Governor, gathering momentum for protests British colonial rule.

What happened?

- Due to Nkrumah's (Nkrumah was leader of United Gold Coast Convention 1949 inspired by Gandhi and India, formed Convention People's Party CPP) popularity and influence he became Prime Minister in 1952.
- Neighbouring British Mandate Togoland's plebiscite in 1956 delivered overwhelming vote in favour of unification of Gold Coast. 
- 1957 support for independence was so strong that new elections were held on full adult suffrage. This led to full independence on 6 March 1957 as Ghana. 

Why did Ghana become independent when it did?
- Rise of nationalism and the strong charismatic leader of Kwame Nkrumah as the leader of CPP and the CPP winning full election confirming popular support for independence. 
- Togoland's plebiscite in 1956.
What was the role of Sir Charles Arden Clarke
- He facilitated Nkrumah's rise to power as he recognised that he had to be included in governance. His advice could not be ignored as he was 'so resolute, experienced and sagacious governor'.  Arden-Clarke released Nkrumah after his imprisonment and then integrated him into the political processes in the country. 
- Arden-Clarke oversaw changes to the constitution that gradually increased Arica representation within government. 
- March 1957 he officially handed over power making Ghana independent having managed the tensions and ensuring a peaceful path to independence. 
What was the role of Kwame Nkrumah?

- Kwame Nkrumah founded the Convention People's Party (CPP) in 1949 and pressurised the British administration to make further concessions.
- This did bring change as the Legislative Council was enlarged and renamed the Legislative Assembly and the number of people who could vote for it increased. However, British Governor still retained ultimate power.
- Nkrumah was jailed in 1950, but despite this the CPP still won two thirds of the seats in the Legislative Assembly in 1951. This made clear to Sir Alan Burns (Governor General 1942-47) that the CPP needed to be brought into Government to bring the troubles under control.
- Thus, Nkrumah was released from jail and named Prime Minister from 1952. 
- Nkrumah's elected government was given control over internal affairs, and his popularity grew.
