Kenya
Context
- Seizure of land by settlers and squatters caused high tensions
o 3000 European farmers owned 12k miles^2 of cultivable land while over a million Kikuyu farmers were allotted 2k miles^2. 
- Most public facilities were segregated
- Pre-war: Indigenous peoples and squatters benefitted from technological growth, but settlers suffered from the Great Depression
- Post-war: settlers could sell their crops for profit and pay off mortgages
o 1946-52: 100k squatters deprived of their livestock without compensation
- 1944: Kenya Africa Union (KAU) formed, based on principles of uhuru (freedom)
- 1948: Governor Mitchell said that self-rule would be impossible in the near future
o Refused to appoint KAU leader Kenyatta to Legislative Council
- Mau Mau: movement started in the 1940s by mostly Kikuyu against British rule

Events
- 1952: the first major insurrection to challenge British rule
o Escalation of murders by Mau-Mau of mostly other Kikuyu + some white farmers
o Oct 1952: Chief of Kikuyu assassinated
o New governor Evelyn Baring II declared a State of Emergency
* Black African political rights suspended + political leaders imprisoned
o Thousands of troops sent to Kenya, posing awkward moral position for British
o Britain recruited local Kikuyu, attacked with aeroplanes, and relocated Kikuyu villages to cut off supply lines
o At least 80k detained, some kept in detention camps and beaten and used for labour
o Unfair trials- Kenyatta's prosecution witness was bribed
o Mau Mau held out for 5 years but were defeated
o Consequences of conflict:
* Thousands interned in rehabilitation camps where torture was used
* 1959: atrocities at the Hola Camp came to light, shocking Britain
- New Governor Renison paved way for independence and black majority rule
o 1963: Kenyan independence, 1500 remaining Mau Mau guerillas laid down arms
- Rebellion showed that the government was poorly equipped to deal with insurrection
- £5.7m spent
- About 13500 Africans killed, and only 32 Europeans were murdered

Main Factors for Kenyan Independence in 1963
- Lack of moral standing in Kenya
- Growing pressures from UN
- Fears of the country dissolving into chaos
- Not wanting chaos to spread to neighbouring territories
- Cold War considerations
- Accepted that Kenya was impossible to continue ruling without use of great force
o Would be costly and may just repeat the Mau Mau emergency
- Changing attitudes from the British Government
o Macmillan's 'Winds of Change' Speech
o The government were influenced by the Mau Mau insurrection

Jomo Kenyatta
- Prioritised social tradition and political independence for the Kikuyu, wanting independence to be achieved without revolution
- Helped unite many of the Indigenous groups in Kenya in solidarity
- 1947: became leader of the KAU, regarded as dangerous by Governor Mitchell
- 1952: wrongfully imprisoned during the State of Emergency
- Became prime minister of Kenya (1963), and then President (1964)
