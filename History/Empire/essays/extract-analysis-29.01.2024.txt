Using your understanding of the historical context, assess how convincing the arguments in this extract are in relation to Britain's policies in South Africa in the late 19th century.

Simms argues that the main driver behind the desire for British hegemony in South Africa was a strategic interest in protecting the port at Durban. He continues to argue that mineral wealth in the form of diamonds and gold is not as important as strategic aspects. Simms then states that the actions of the German Empire as a regional rivalry and then the final actions of Kruger were vital. This argument is supported by the fact that Joseph Chamberlain and his predecessor, Lord Carnarvon, had desired British hegemony over the region predating the gold rush in the Transvaal region. This was due to a desire for British hegemony among the perceived weaker native Bantu people and Boer settlers. Simms' argument can be further corroborated by the fact that Germans have been further investing in the area in an effort to gain a tighter grip on South Africa. The Germans offered an alliance in the Kruger telegram and would fund a railroad for the Boers to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique for them to access the ocean. The Germans would later fund and arm the Boers throughout the wars, and this would help them fight against the British for three years. However, the large British investment in the area contradicts Simms' point that this was not the most important factor. By 1899, there had been £350 million pounds of British investment in the Transvaal, and this meant that the British had a large interest in the Transvaal and specifically the Witswaterrand. This can be further evidenced by the fact that when the Kimberly diamond rush happened, the boundaries of the Cape colony changed, and this war could be seen as an extension of that to the Transvaal gold rush. Overall, Simms' argument is the most convincing as it reflects the imperial policy and strategic situation of the time.
