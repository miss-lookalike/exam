The Ottoman Empire was ruled by a sultan who also claimed to be the caliph (the spiritual leader's closest equivalent is the pope). Sultan declared World War I to be Jihad, which would cause Muslims to join in the fight against the British. The British had the largest population of Muslims, and this could be very disruptive. Sultan was unpopular with Muslims within and without his own empire. By inciting Jihad, the Sultan starts rebellions with his own empire.Â

#### What were Lawrence's views on Arab [[nationalism]]?

He believed in it. It was promised by MacMahn Correspondence from MacMahn to Hussein. Lawrence believed that it was the right thing and became very close with Prince Feisal. Lawrence went to Versailles with the Hashemite delegation pushing the case of Arab self-determination ([[wilsonian-idealism]]).

#### What was Lawrence's attitude to British imperialism after the First World War? 

Became critical of it due to the failure of the empire to provide the Arab [[nationalism]] he thinks is deserved. Fell out with home office. Published *Seven Pillars of Wisdom* (1926) which started the Lawrence of Arabia mythos. He died in 1935 in a motorcycle crash (going recklessly extremely fast). Was tortured by the situation in Arabia and his sexuality for many years. Hashemite's were pushed out by the Saud's eventually. 

Feisal was made king of Iraq (Mesopotamia) and Abdullah was given Jordan (Transjordan). Hashemite's are still in charge in Jordan.
