Gene Sharp - 

Gandhi effectively used political power against his opponents. Gandhi used non-cooperation and disobedience to cut off sources of the ruler's power. It was difficult to retaliate against these methods as it would alienate people at home. He was acutely aware of political reality.

BR Nanda - 

His tactics were largely failures. People believed in non-violence against the Raj but not as a way of life, his philosophical writings were dismissed as too lofty. Congress ignored him over Japan in WW2. He wrote little of governmental structure but instead of individual responsibility, he wanted India to remain agrarian. Ultimately those who would create the constitution in 1947 would pay little heed to his ideas.

Nehru's modernist views of India won out in the end in the 1930s and onwards. Additionally Muslim league and Congress would split between Nehru and Jinnah.

Sudhir Chandra -

Gandhi failed to create true non-violence but instead passive resistance which was non-violence for the weak. This was repressed in the Indian people and would erupt as soon as the British left India.

Fasial Devji - 

Most radical 20th century revolutionary because he wanted revolutionary violence but violence inflicted on himself.

Talat Ahmed -

Gandhi understands public relations much better than the viceroy and uses this to make them land on the nationalist side.
