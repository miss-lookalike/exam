1921-22 - Anglo-Irish Treaty:

- Michael Collins invited to 10 Downing Street to negotiate a truce
- The Irish Free State would become a self-governing dominion within the British Empire
- The British monarch would remain Head of State
- The northern six counties would have the option (which they took up) of remaining part of the United Kingdom and would have their own parliament at Stormont
- The British would retain control over several ‘treaty ports’  for the  use  of  the Royal Navy 

Outcomes: 

- Ireland partitioned between north and south 
- Eamon de Valera (one of Sinn Fein’s leaders) refused to accept the compromises of the  Anglo-Irish  treaty  and  launched  the  Irish  civil  war  (1922-23)  in  which  the  pro-Treaty side (Collins assassinated in this war) won. 
- Still  unsatisfied,  de  Valera  used  the  1931  Statute  of  Westminster  which  granted dominions  complete  autonomy  within  the empire,  to  effectively  separate  Ireland completely. It was renamed Eire in 1937
- Ireland remained neutral in WW2 and refused to let Britain use the treaty ports. Churchill offered Ulster in exchange for use of the treaty ports.
- In  1948  the  Republic  of  Ireland  Act  separated  Ireland  completely  from  the  British Empire, declared it a republic and Ireland left the Commonwealth.  
- Northern  Ireland  remained  part  of  the  United  Kingdom  and,  from  1969-1998 ‘The Troubles’ saw sectarian conflict between the Catholic (nationalist) and Protestant (unionist) communities there.
