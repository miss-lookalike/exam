> There was an illusory quality to Britannia's victorious peace. True, the Empire had never been bigger. But nor had the costs of victory, by comparison with which the economic value of these new territories was negligible, if not negative. No combatant power spent as much on the war as Britain, whose total expenditure amounted to just under £10 billion. That was a steep price to pay even more a million square miles, especially as they generally cost more to govern that they yielded in revenue. The cost of running Iraq, to give just one example, amounted in 1921 to £23 million, more than the total UK health budget. Before 1914, the benefits of Empire had seemed to most people, on balance, to outweigh the costs. After the war the costs suddenly, inescapably, outweighed the benefits.

The price of the empire was high and so was the war. After WW1 it seemed no longer correct on balance to support the empire as it was costing much more than seemed worth.

> The Bolshevik ([[bolshevism]]) and Wilsonian ([[wilsonian-idealism]]) declarations on national self-determination were accompanied by other intellectual and political trends related to world peace, international cooperation, universal suffrage, and women's rights. All of these emerged before or during, and merged decisively with the end of, the Great War. The war itself was decisive in the perceived destruction of the old world and the creation of the hopes and possibilities for a new one. After the cessation of hostilities, there was a heightened awareness of the interconnectedness of the world and a renewed hope for its future prosperity. The destruction of the certainties, social stability, and hierarchies of the old world by the new post-Great War world, in Europe and elsewhere, was an enabling factor in creating a new perception of the world. An earlier, narrower set of knowledge and experiences of interconnection among Indian elites, soldiers or seaman (for it was the lascars who were the largest group of South Asian travellers across the world before the Great War), was far enlarged by the war.

The war had created a "new world" built upon the ideas of world peace and self-determination and suffrage. It also galvanised and expanded movements such as the Indian nationalist movement partially due to the further global interconnectedness felt during this period.
