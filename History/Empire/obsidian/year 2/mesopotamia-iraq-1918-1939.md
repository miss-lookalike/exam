Assumption that, like Iran, oil could be found in Mesopotamia  

- **1919** – British administered [[mandate-history|mandate]] (category A) of the  League of Nations –disappointing hopes from Arab nationalists 
- **1919 and 1920** – revolts against British rule (esp. from the Kurds in the north) → Kurdish uprising crushed by British and Indian troops – high costs to Britain (£40 million) and brutal methods. Use of air power to maintain control – cheaper.
- **1921** – Cairo Conference  
- **1922** – Anglo-Iraqi Treaty – Faisal I (Hashemite Dynasty) confirmed as king of Iraq – Britain retained control of foreign policy and defence and maintained armed forces in the country  
- **1927** – Kirkuk oil fields open – run by Turkish Oil Company (Western financed not Turkish)  
- **1930** – Anglo Iraqi Treaty – consultation between Iraq and Britain on foreign policy but British mandate officially ended 
- **1932** – full independence nominally granted – although Britain retained much influence through the dominance of the British oil industry + the RAF retained air bases in the country  
- **1941** – British occupation of Basra in the south → Iraqi government asked for help from the Axis → six-week campaign to restore British rule over Iraq
