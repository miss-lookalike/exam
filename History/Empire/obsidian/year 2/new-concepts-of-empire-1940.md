- Development of colonial possessions to encourage economic growth 
    - Attempt to increase dollar reserves through investment in colonial exports 
    - 1948: Colonial Development Corporation to coordinate this 
    - Example of success: Malayan rubber 
    - Example of failure: Tanganyika Groundnuts Scheme, 1948 
    - Problem: Commonwealth countries and colonies relied on export of 
    - limited range of primary products to Britain (lack of diversity)

- Development of colonial possessions for the sake of ‘trusteeship’ – to justify imperial rule in the post-war world 
    - The Empire would centre on Africa and the economic and social development of the colonial peoples there 
        - Problems: There was never enough money available to invest in development on a large scale. The development that did occur tended to displace the traditional indigenous elites on whose collaboration the British had relied, and encouraged a new, literate, articulate class of nationalists.

[[u6-empire-booklet-2024]] - page 100


- Maintenance of informal empire: protection of strategic interests through the Commonwealth after formal decolonisation 
- Continuation of the ‘dominion’ idea → bonds of friendship = strategic allies 
- Cold War context – prevent independent states entering the Soviet sphere of influence  
- Cultivation of sympathetic elites to whom power could be handed 
- Britain would retain its ‘great power’ status and rival the two superpowers as a ‘Third Force’ in geopolitics 
- Problem: once independent, states would not necessarily stay in 
    - Britain’s sphere of influence and could easily plough their own furrow.
