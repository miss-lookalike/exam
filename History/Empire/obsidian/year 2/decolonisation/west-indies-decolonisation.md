The West Indies at this time provided very limited economic value, for about 100 years. Decolonisation was driven by a desire to have a strong and independent dominion in the West Indies and a common agreement between the British and nationalists. There was also further pressure from the United States due to the geographic position of the West Indies - the American's would later invade Grenada in 1983 without consulting the British. 

This led to the formation of the federation, however it completely collapsed by 1962 indicating that Britain had failed to successfully decolonise. West Indies federation still competes in cricket and still has West Indies university.
