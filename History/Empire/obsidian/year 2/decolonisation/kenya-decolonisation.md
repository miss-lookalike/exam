###### Overview

- **Mau Mau Movement**: Kenyan movement, mainly Kikuyu.  
- **Causes**:  
  - Kikuyu suffered land shortages (due to white settlers).  
  - High unemployment and poor urban conditions.  
- **Origins**: Dates back to the 1940s.  
- **Major Insurrection**: 1952, challenged British colonial rule.  
- **Colonial Vulnerability**:  
  - Regime relied on privileged white settlers.  
  - Settlers opposed black majority political/economic power.  
- **Governor’s Role**:  
  - Sir Philip Mitchell (Governor).  
  - 1948: Declared self-government not possible soon.  
  - Increased black Kenyan frustration.  

- **Escalation of Violence (1952)**:  
  - Mau Mau increased murders, targeting white farmers and Kikuyu who refused to take the oath (many were Christians).  
  - Kikuyu Chief Waruhiu wa Kungu opposed Mau Mau but was assassinated (Oct 1952).  
  - Reports of ritualistic oaths fuelled white settler panic, leading to demands for harsh reprisals.  

- **British Response**:  
  - Insurgency posed a serious challenge; guerrilla tactics were difficult to counter.  
  - **Governor Sir Evelyn Baring** declared a **State of Emergency (1952)**:  
    - Suspended all black African political rights.  
    - Branded Mau Mau as terrorists.  
    - Arrested black leaders, including Jomo Kenyatta (wrongly accused).  
    - Sent thousands of British troops to suppress the rebellion.  

- **British Military Actions**:  
  - Used massive repression, including a **home guard** of loyal Kikuyu, ground troops, helicopters, and planes.  
  - Mau Mau were gradually defeated, cornered in forests near Mount Kenya.  
  - Kikuyu villages uprooted, cutting off Mau Mau support from White Highlands.  

- **Atrocities & Repression**:  
  - British executed suspects and interned thousands in **‘rehabilitation camps’**.  
  - **Torture & forced confessions** were widespread.  
  - Official estimates (1952–1956): **11–12,000 killed, 81,000 detained**.  
  - Some historians estimate much higher:  
    - **David Anderson**: 25,000 killed.  
    - **Caroline Elkins**: 130,000–300,000 unaccounted for.  
  - **Hola Camp Massacre (1959)**: 11 inmates killed, exposing abuses.  
  - British press reports caused embarrassment, but **State of Emergency lasted until 1960**.  
  - 
- **Macmillan’s ‘Wind of Change’ Speech (1960)**:
    - Signaled a shift in British policy towards African independence.
    - Partly influenced by the Mau Mau insurrection.
- **Steps Towards Independence**:
    - **Governor Sir Patrick Renison** facilitated black majority rule.
    - **Kenya gained independence in 1963**.
    - 1,500 remaining Mau Mau guerrillas surrendered.
- **Impact of the Mau Mau Rebellion**:
    - Exposed colonial governments’ inability to handle large-scale uprisings.
    - Created deep concern about future insurrections.
    - Debate remains on whether it was a true nationalist movement.
