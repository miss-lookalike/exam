###### Successful or not?

- Could have been worse as far is Britain is concerned
    - Israel relationship maintained, Middle East relationship maintained (damaged by [[suez-crisis]])
    - Maintained relationship with USA 
    - USA + UN take the blame
    - Most interests of Britain are preserved
    - Example of scuttle
        - however, they tried to find solutions but ultimately it was out of their reach
