###### Context

- Straits settlement had been ruled as a crown colony since 19th century - most importantly trading entrepot Singapore.
- Rest of Malaya was ruled as protectorates by indigenous Sultans - i.e. Princely states in India

1947 demographics:
- Malays: 49.5%
- Chinese: 38.4%
- Indians: <10%
- British: small minority

Chinese and Indians were economically dominant.

###### WW2

- Japanese invasion led to collapse of Singapore
- 1942-1945 harsh Japanese rule - led to Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army - supported by British force 136
- Japanese surrender after atomic bombs led to MPAJA claiming they liberated the island 

###### Re-establishment of British rule

- Important economically as it allowed British to sell rubber and tin to USA which was more wanted during korean war.
- The straits became significantly strategically important
- British pushed for Malayan Union with equality for ethnicities and abolished sultanates 
    - However, Malays resisted since it would make them a minority. Formed United Malays National Organisation led by Dato' Sir Onn Bin Dato' Jaafar. Wanted privelige status for Malays. 

- British came up with an offer to give preference to Malays and remove rights of Chinese. Chinese resisted with Malayan Communist party growin led by guerilla fighter Chin Peng.
- Nationwide Hartal (strike) started on 20 October 1947

###### Emergency

- 16th June 1948 - three British rubber plantation owners were murdered by members of the MCP starting a Guerilla war. 
- Initial response was coercion and enforcement - incident at village of Batang Kali in December 1948 where 24 civilians were killed by guards 'Britan's My Lai' 
- Commonwealth troops from Aus, NZ, Rhodesia
- Nadir when Sir Henry Gurney (British Governor) assassinated in October 1951

- Replacement Sir Gerald Templer wanted to win the hearts and minds of the Chinese 
- Ideological battleground of the cold war
- Chinese communities relocated to safe areas and MCP starved out of jungle
- Majority of population disliked MCP and American's supported British here (anti communism > anti imperialism)

###### Merdeka (independence)

- Under control by the British by mid 1950s - elections for federal council led to 51/52 seats going to multi-racial, pro-British, alliance party
- independence was arranged for the 31st of August 1957, emergency declared over in 1960 and Malaya remained in the Commonwealth. 
- In 1963 they allied with Singapore and Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia but Singapore left in 1965 due to political and ethnic differences
- Communist threat eliminated, sympathetic indigenous government, maintained influence. Military presence in Singapore and economic interests
- Since 1960s, Britain allied to Malaya, Singapore, Aus, NZ in Five Power Defence agreement

- Similar to informal empire - all the benefits and interests secured without the burdens and costs of formal ruling.

How and why did decolonisation happen?
- It happened when British interests were secured with a sympathetic government, nothing to lose and much to gain by allowing it. 

- Nationalism mostly failed with the MCP being defeated both militarily then electorally
- economically Britain retained a strong position by removing the burdens of rule but keeping the trade benefits
- geopolitically their war was supported by the population and American's and the empire gained a new role as anti-communist force in Asia
- Changes in Britain more reflect a willingness to decolonise

- Very successful for all parties involved


***

Nationalism - 
- UMNO - Ethnic Malays
    - want to protect interests of ethnic Malays (+ privilege them)
    - anti-Communist - side with British to defeat MCP
- MCP - Ethnic Chinese
    - 1948 - guerilla war 'the emergency'
    like viet cong

- General Gerald Templer - 'Winning the hearts and minds'
    - relocates people in villages who supplied the MCP and move them into fortified villages and starve out the MCP
        - strategic hamlets Vietnam

Economic 
- very important for Britain
    - tin, rubber (biggest producer in the world) - export to US for the $ - lots of dollars into the British empire
        - price rises during Korean war - highly profitable
    - therefore, it is important for Malaya to not become communist 


Geopolitical context 
- Britain humiliated by Japanese invasion
- But 'emergency' encourages Britain to re-establish authority 
- general American principle on imperialism is ignored here in face of anti-communism

Changes in Britain 
- Both Labour + Conservatives are keen to maintain influence in Malaya - economic + geopolitical reasons
- independence will only happen once there is security of British interests 
    - will to continue imperialism 

How successful - 
- 1957 (independence) 
    - communists defeated
    - pro British government in Malaya:
        - anti communist, allied, economic interests protected
    - decolonisation makes sense - 19th century idea of 'informal empire'
