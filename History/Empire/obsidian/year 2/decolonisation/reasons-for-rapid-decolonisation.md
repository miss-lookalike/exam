- Britain feared having an 'Algeria' or even worse a 'Congo'
- They sought to decolonise as a way of avoiding the consequences other nations were facing and being dragged into conflict
    - Algeria (French) - stayed too long
    - Congo (Belgium) - left too quick 
    - Both were disasters - Macmillan wanted to be somewhere in between the two
- The British saw their only option to be working with nationalists
    - The empire had always rested on collaborative power this was just a new form
    - The British wanted to work with nationalists such as Kenyatta or Nkruhma
