##### 1941–48: The Impact of the Second World War Burma

###### Nationalism

- **Japanese Influence on Nationalism**
    - Japanese occupation in 1943 granted Burma limited self-government under Ba Maw, a puppet leader.
    - Aung San initially supported the Japanese, believing they could advance Burmese nationalism, alienating minority groups like the Karens, who opposed the Japanese.
- **Aung San and the Burma National Army**
    - In 1944–45, Aung San’s Burma National Army switched sides, joining the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL) alongside communists.
    - Aung San demonstrated significant influence, prompting British recognition of his power.
- **Rise of Burmese Autonomy**
    - Sir Hubert Rance, appointed as governor in 1946, worked with Aung San, recognizing Britain’s inability to hold Burma by force.
    - Burmese elections, won by the AFPFL, pushed for complete severance from Britain.

###### Economics

- **Economic Decline of Burma's Importance**
    - Post-Indian independence, Burma’s economic and strategic significance to Britain diminished compared to Malaya.
    - Britain’s focus shifted to preventing communism in the region during the Cold War.

###### Geopolitical Changes

- **Independence and Civil War**
    - After Aung San’s assassination in July 1947, Burma became an independent republic but quickly descended into civil war.
    - Conflicts included a communist insurrection and Karen separatism.
    - Britain’s loss of influence led to concerns about Chinese intervention supporting communists, marking a failure of decolonization.

##### 1900–41: The Build-Up to Change Burma

###### Nationalism

- **Initial Nationalist Movements**
    - Burma was incorporated into British India after a brutal conquest in 1885, with Burmese hostility toward economic immigration from Bengal.
    - Early nationalism emerged with the Young Men’s Buddhist Association (YMBA) in 1906, advocating for cultural and religious revival.
    - Protests included symbolic actions like opposing British shoe-wearing near pagodas (1916).
- **Student-Led Radicalization**
    - In the 1930s, student groups like the Thakins emerged, advocating more radical, left-wing nationalism.
    - They organized strikes and demonstrations, opposing the British-backed constitutional framework and Burma’s involvement in World War II (1939).

###### Economics

- **Rural Discontent and Rebellion**
    - Rural dissatisfaction led to the Hsaya San Rebellion (1930–32), driven by grievances over taxes, landlessness, and police oppression.
    - The rebellion resulted in 1,300 deaths before being suppressed.

###### Geopolitical Changes

- **Separation from India**
    - The Government of India Act (1935) separated Burma from India, establishing its own administrative office in London.
    - The new constitution introduced a form of responsible government with Burmese ministers and legislature under British oversight.

###### Changes in Britain

- **British Response to Nationalism**
    - The reforms aimed to appease the Burmese elite and delay further demands for independence.
    - However, radical nationalist movements continued to grow, challenging the British administration.
