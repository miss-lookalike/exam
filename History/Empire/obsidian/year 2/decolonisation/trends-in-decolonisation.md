These are influential in India but also in further decolonisation round the empire:

1. Periphery - nationalism
2. Metropole - political/global changes in Britain
3. Economics
4. External - changing geopolitics 

Examples:

- India saw continued nationalism with the strong presence of the INC and the quit India movement headed by Gandhi. 
- The Attlee government was more reluctant to hold onto colonial possessions that did not directly benefit Britain more than they burdened. The government shifted priorities towards nuclear weapons and the welfare state, [[foreign-policy-post-ww2|Ernest Bevin]] prioritised nuclear weapons. 
- Economically, Britain was in a dire state after the war and thus could not afford the cost of garrisoning troops in many colonies. Additionally, the government wished to focus further on domestic matters such as a health service and welfare state. India was no longer an important market for British goods so there was less need to keep a governing relationship.
- Additionally, with the further influence of America and the proliferation of the ideas of nationalist sovereignty and self governance there were a further discredit brought to empires.
