###### Lion's share:

'serious riots in Accra in the Gold Coast in 1948: not nationalist uprisings in origin, but used and exploited by nationalists after they had begun.'

'An issue on which the two sides frequently collided head-on was the position of the traditional chiefs in Africa, whom nationalists regarded as little better than British puppets, about as representative of modern democratic African opinion as dukes and
earls were of the English, but who continued to play a large role in British plans for Africa’s future well on into the 1950s, because (said the Labour government about the Gold Coast in 1948) ‘a large part of the country’ still regarded them as ‘essential to an ordered society’, and considered the nationalists as parvenus.'

'The first democratic elections held in Ghana and Nigeria in 1951–52 seemed fully to vindicate all the nationalists’ claims to represent the people. The British government took the lesson to heart, and acted on it: releasing from gaol the Gold Coast’s leading ‘extremist’, Kwame Nkrumah, to make him ‘prime minister’ for the interim period before independence; and in both countries negotiating thereafter with the nationalists, and letting the chiefs alone.'

###### Lawrence James

'Since 1894, ratepayers had been able to vote for half the membership of village and town councils, but it was a right which few chose to exercise. In 1922 only 46 of the 1,117 registered electors in Accra turned out on polling day and none of the 717 in Sekondi bothered to appear at all.'

'In 1958 Accra was host to the first All-African Peoples Conference which called for the liberation of the whole continent from imperial rule.'
