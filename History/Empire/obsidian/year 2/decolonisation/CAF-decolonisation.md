In southern-central Africa the situation was complicated by the demographics of the colonies there:  
- Northern Rhodesia (70,000 white people; 2 million Africans)  
- Southern Rhodesia (221,000 white people; 3.5 million Africans)
	- Known as bread basket of Africa - lots of food
- Nyasaland (7,000 white people; 2.5 million Africans)

The British government found themselves stuck between two pressures. The white settlers had hoped to create a new dominion and resisted any attempts to limit their rights of self-government, or introduce black majority rule. On the other hand, the British government was determined not to resist the pressures from African nationalism and sought to introduce more representative forms of government for the indigenous population.

Northern Rhodesia was a significant source of copper, while Southern Rhodesia was largely agricultural. There were extremes of wealth with the majority of the black population earning less than a tenth of the white population.  

The Central African Federation was established in 1953, incorporating Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The British hoped to accommodate continuing white demands for autonomy  
(essentially white minority rule) with growing African demands for self-government.  

However, growing nationalism was getting out of control in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland amongst black Africans opposed to the Federation and the privileges it gave to the white community. Kenneth Kaunda in Northern Rhodesia and Dr Hastings Banda in Nyasaland led resistance to the Federation. Developing violence in Nyasaland led to a declaration of a state of emergency in 1959 and  
the arrest of Banda. Over 1300 Africans were arrested without trial and 20 people lost their lives in the Nkata Bay incident.
