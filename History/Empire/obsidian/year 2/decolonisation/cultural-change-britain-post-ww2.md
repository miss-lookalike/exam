# The Chatterley Trial (1960)

*Lady Chatterley's Lover* was a novel that was initially banned due to featuring explicit scenes. This went to court and Penguin (the publisher) fought that it should be published. It was an important measuring point for how liberal people believe society should be.

'Is it the kind of book you would wish your wife or servant to read?' - Director of Public Prosecution

> Sexual intercourse began
> In nineteen sixty-three
> (which was rather late for me) -
> Between the end of the Chatterley Ban
> And the first Beatles LP

- Philip Larkin, *Annus Mirabillis*
