1918 – the Wafd (led by Said Zaghul) appealed for Egyptian independence 
(Wilson’s  ideals  of  national  self-determination - [[wilsonian-idealism]]). Wafd dominated by 
effendiya landowning class and professionals. 

March, 1919: 
- Lord  Curzon  (Foreign  Sec.)  –  miscalculated  and  ordered  a  harsh response: leading members of Wafd arrested/ exiled  
- → widespread unrest: riots and strikes in towns and sabotage of infrastructure.  
- British showed much racial contempt towards the Egyptians: ruthless tactics including firing on crowds and using aircraft → 1,500 Egyptians killed in 8 weeks of fighting (comparisons with Indian Mutiny) 
- General Allenby brought in to deal with the situation → concessions: Wafd leaders brought back from exile 


1919, Milner Report – recommended conciliation 

1922 – nominal ‘independence’ granted under King Fuad (anti Wafd and pro-British). Britain retained control over defence, the Canal, the Sudan etc. 

Wafd  remained  the  dominant  political  group  –  appeals  to  patriotism  gained  support  from  poorer classes. Some terrorist cells on the fringes. 

Nov 1924 – arguments over possession of Sudan → assassination of Sir Lee Stack, Governor-General of the Sudan, in Cairo. 

1935 – Wafd organised a fresh wave of popular protest + pressures from Mussolini’s expansionism in the Mediterranean → a settlement was needed. 

1936  –  Anglo-Egyptian Treaty  –  Full  independence  for  Egypt  but  Britain  still  retained  control of the Suez Canal zone and garrisons and RAF bases in Egypt, and the naval facilities at Alexandria (Context: fear of Italian aggression from Libya) 

1939 – Egyptian government reluctant to declare war on Germany: King Faruq sympathetic to Axis → forced by the British in February 1942 to appoint Mustafa al Naha (Wafd leader) as Prime Minister – Wafd  now  sympathetic  to the  Allies.  Egypt  remained an  important  strategic  location  for the British Armed Forces during WWII.
