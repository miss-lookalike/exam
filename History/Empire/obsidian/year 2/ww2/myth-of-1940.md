###### The Myth

1. Britain was involved in a 'David vs. Goliath' struggle with Germany (with Britain playing the part of David)
2. That Britain stood in great peril in the summer of 1940: it achieved a 'miracle' at Dunkirk and then saved itself from likely invasion in the Battle of Britain
3. That Britain stood alone against Germany
4. That Britain sacrificed itself as a world power to ride the world of Nazism - 1940 becomes the central drama in explain Britain's 'decline'

###### The reality

1. Britain's armed forces were much better equipped than the German armed forces - the army were small, but the Raf had the edge over the Luftwaffe and the RN was much bigger than the Kriegsmarine
	- The German's being technologically advanced is merely Nazi propaganda. Most of the German's entering France were on horseback. 
2. The Dunkirk evacuation represented a strategic catastrophe for Britain. However, the threat of invasion was always tiny and the  RAF was never on the verge of defeat during the Battle of Britain
3. Britain was never 'alone' and stood alongside its empire and the dominions at the centre of a 'world system' of trade and influence
	- Only a quarter of the British eighth army during 1941 were actually from Britain
4. Britain did not consciously sacrifice itself in 1940 for the greater good; Britain still aspired to 'superpower' status into the 1950s and the 'myth of decline' is a much longer phenomenon
