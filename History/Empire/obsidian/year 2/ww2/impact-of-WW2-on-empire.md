Atlantic charter source - [[u6-empire-booklet-2024]] - p78

- Atlantic charter is a document signed by FDR and Churchill that promises nations after the end of the WW2:
	- National self determination
	- International collaboration
	- Dissolution of military power (point 8)
- It is non-binding as it is a charter and is more a moral statement than a binding treaty.
- It is intended for people under the Axis to make them fall away from the Axis, it is also to intend to convince American people and congress to want to support Churchill
- August, 1941 - before Pearl harbour, attempt to try and shape American public opinion of what Britain is fighting for. 
- Shapes narrative of the war - Freedom vs oppression and tyranny
- It is problematic for the British empire as it seemingly promises national self determination for peoples under imperial force - particularly point three

Keith Jeffery interpretation - [[u6-empire-booklet-2024]] - p77

- WW2 was the highest point of the empire but contained its worst and best. 
- WW2 saw a rise of imperial authoritarianism from Britain. Force was the essential thing holding the empire together in WW2, both internally and externally. Where force failed the empire was gravely injured, e.g. Dunkirk and Singapore. 
- Promises of self determination came from a will to persuade the Americans to join the war. 
- Due to force failing there must be a revision of imperial rule Sir John Shuckburgh argued for a need for genuine interracial collaboration between colonial subjects and masters. 
	- New ideas for empire: development, consent, cooperation, trusteeship (already have [[mandate-history|mandates]] in Middle East), commonwealth -> new justification / excuses for empire
- Even problems not caused by WW2 were majorly exacerbated, the cost of defending the Empire was the Empire itself.
