- WW2, in particular, damaged Britain’s prestige at least as much as its finances
- Darwin places emphasis on the years 1938-1942 in explaining why the Empire dissolved 
- the  virtual  bankruptcy  of  the  British  government  left  it financially (and militarily) dependent on the United States with important ramifications for the future relationship of these two countries
- there were swift  incursions into British-held territory; the German advance into Egypt and, most significantly, the Japanese advance in the Far East meant that the British Empire looked set to collapse.
- the fall of Singapore and the loss of Burma to a non-European power were of great encouragement to nationalists and it was in this context that the ‘Quit India’ campaign  was launched
- Despite  reconquering  the temporarily  lost  territories  after the defeat of the Axis, Britain’s prestige and the legitimacy of its rule in Asia could not be restored.

- Neither the USSR nor the USA saw the maintenance of  the  European  colonial  empires  as  a  priority  and the  onset  of  the  Cold  War  resulted  in  meddling  in the Third World by the two superpowers who both sought  influence  there for strategic and ideological reasons
- the Suez Crisis is clearly the most obvious example of this when American disapproval left the British with a profound sense of their own impotence. 
	- As Burbank  and Cooper have put  it, ‘The Suez fiasco was a sign of something that had already happened – the loss of coercive capacity and political authority by the colonial powers of Western Europe.'

- one of the most important products of both the Second World War and the Cold War was  the  swift  acceptance  that  empires  were  now  a  thing  of  the  past. 
- the fact that the  two superpowers  were  both  ideologically  hostile  to  European  imperialism  meant  that  nationalists  now operated in an international climate that was very sympathetic towards them.
	- USSR - always anti-imperialist 
	- USA - Wilson's fourteen points
- The Second World War meant that the racial assumptions which lay behind empire were not simply discredited in Britain, but across the world; the intangible, if potent, force of ‘world opinion’ could be appealed to by nationalists everywhere. 
- Nation-states rather than rickety empires seemed to be the norm; the Axis having sullied the latter concept completely
- However, it was more the triumph of an abstract concept which gained widespread acceptance as a result of geo-political events, rather than the triumph of specific nationalist movements.
