Dunkirk is a sign of defeat, Britain and France have been defeated. Do Britain make peace with Hitler or do they keep on fighting? Days before Chamberlain had resigned from his post and was replaced by Winston Churchill. Churchill vs Lord Halifax - Halifax is for appeasement but Churchill wins because Labour opposition leader (Clement Atlee) refuses to go into coalition with someone supporting Atlee. Churchill convinces government and parliament.

Churchill was a convincing user of rhetoric - 'finest hour' speech. Churchill understood the armed forces better than others in government, knew how to win an war - sea power and air power were crucial and Britain were in the best position here. 

Churchill when he mentions 'Britain alone' he means the empire too and sees them as a great strength. He also eludes to the idea that this will eventually be the American's issue too so tries to get them to join the British in the war. Churchill believes they have common interests due to their Anglo-Saxon heritage.
