What are the reasons for the growth of nationalism after WW2?
- Precedent of India
- Development -> urbanisation, education
- Intervention -> destabilises 'light touch' rule -> antagonises
- Constitutional development -> bring in representative processes
- Impact of WW2 + values associated with allies 
	- Atlantic Charter (1941) - democracy, freedom, values
- Charismatic individuals 

Why might we not see nationalism as necessarily responsible for decolonisation everywhere?
- There were other factors such as changing domestic policy and oftentimes the British encouraged nationalism as a way to ensure good relations and stability with a country. 

Why did the British often seek to work with nationalists?
- The British wanted stability and for countries to remain in the commonwealth as it would be beneficial to the British.
