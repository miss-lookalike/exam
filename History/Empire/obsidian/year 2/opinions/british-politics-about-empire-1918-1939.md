Changing political context: 
- Representation of the People Act, 1918 – all men and most women over 30 could vote. Britain now  largely democratic. (Equal Franchise Act, 1928) 
- ‘The Strange Death of Liberal England’ (G. Dangerfield) – decline of the Liberal Party in 1920s 
- Rise  of  the  Labour  Party:  minority  governments  (Jan-Nov 1924 & 1929-31) 
- Era of Conservative dominance (Coalition, 1918-22; Majority, 1922-24; Majority, 1924-29; National Government, 1931-39) – Stanley Baldwin the dominant figure 

The Empire in British Politics:
- Imperial matters pushed to the background – cross-party agreement on most issues (e.g. Government of India Act, 1935)  
- Key individual: Leo Amery, Colonial Secretary, 1924-29 – emphasis on imperial consolidation and development  
- Exception: a faction of the Conservatives (Churchill) who were very hostile to any relaxation of imperial control (Churchill’s description of Gandhi as ‘a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a faqir of a type well-known in the east.’)

Porter argues that socialists and nationalists were sowing further doubts. However, there was also a large number of doubts that came purely from the moral shift of people in the 20th century. Imperialism lots its idealists when people began to further consider the humanity of imperial subjects.
