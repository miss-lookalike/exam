Uniting the empire:
Uniting such a disparate empire was a challenge and, throughout the inter-war period, officials tried to promote an appearance of unity and kinship, portraying the Empire as a harmonious and progressive force. Developments in technology coming out of the First World War were used to try to forge this united ethos.

New Technology:
- Civil Aviation – Imperial Airways (est. 1921) – routes throughout the Empire (Empire Flying Boat, 1938)  
- BBC Radio – broadcast around the world. From 1933, royal broadcast on Christmas Day
- Film – Britain had 5,000 cinemas by 1940 – promotion of imperial films (e.g. The Lives of the Bengal Lancers) – censored by the BBFC to ensure the Empire was portrayed as benevolent and ordered. Although, 9/10 films screened were from the USA.

Royalty:  
- Tours by the Prince of Wales throughout 1920s  
- Wembley Empire Exhibition, 1924  
- Silver Jubilee, 1935  
- Coronation of George VI, 1937  

Other symbols of unity:  
- Sporting tours (e.g. the Ashes) 
- Pictorial stamps
