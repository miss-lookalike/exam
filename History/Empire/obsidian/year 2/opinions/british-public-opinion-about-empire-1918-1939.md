In the inter-war years, thousands of British families had friends or relatives who had emigrated to, or served in the Empire as civil servants, teachers, missionaries, engineers, driving locomotives, and as soldiers in the British army. All social classes were influenced in different ways. The churches and Sunday schools provided information about the Empire, as missionaries urged audiences to contribute to medical, educational, and evangelical work throughout the Empire. Missionaries popularized the notion that Western medicine was tackling the most feared tropical diseases in the Empire. The Empire came to the British public in new ways such as through the cinema newsreel, and through the press. British people were, for example, well aware of the Amritsar massacre, which generated much debate. As constitutional reform and eventually decolonization became imminent, the British people were aware of Asian and African politicians visiting London for Round Table Conferences. Among these was Mahatma Gandhi, who in 1931 stayed in London's East End and visited cotton mills, universities and schools. By these means the Empire became an integral part of British culture.

Mackenzie argues that the empire was an important part of British culture and people were no doubt aware of it. He argued that it reached different people in varied ways but it reached them all the same. Porter argues almost the opposite saying general people either were unaware of it or were at best apathetic towards it. Porter argues that people were only tolerant of the empire when it was positively effecting them rather than negatively and were never truly celebratory towards it.

Thompson extract:

It is untrue that most Britons were ignorant of or indifferent to empire; but neither was Britain saturated by imperialism. In the twentieth century, the sources of contact between mother country and colony multiplied and, as a result, a range of relationships with the Empire developed. There was never a single 'imperial culture' in Britain. In addition, disentangling the 'imperial' from the 'international' is problematic. The dividing line between pride in the Empire and in Britain's broader position as a world power was not clear. The monarchy and the military can be seen as twin pillars of popular imperial sentiment. Yet, both appealed to patriotism irrespective of their connection with the Empire. Similarly, the growth of imperial news coverage can be too readily accepted as evidence of enthusiasm for empire when a thirst for mere sensationalism may explain the demand for such reporting.

Thompson here argues that there was a mixed reaction to the empire in this period without a single 'imperial culture' developing. He argues that the monarchy and the military while pillars of the empire were additionally built on patriotism. He further argues that news coverage of imperialism cannot be good evidence as it could just be a preference for sensationalist news.
