Culture and attitudes relating to empire  
- Jingoism and old-style imperialism discredited by the First World War  
- Victorians and Victorian values mocked (Eminent Victorians by Lytton Strachey, 1918) & [[colonel-blimp|Colonel Blimp]] (David Low, 1934)  
- In imperial matters, a return to benevolent paternalism and concepts of ‘trusteeship’ – belief in steady progression towards ‘responsible government’. Yet, a continuing sense of European racial and cultural superiority.

- Racist attitudes in Britain: ‘colour bars’ in operation in Britain + race riots in 1919 in Cardiff and Liverpool in the context of high unemployment and unusually high concentrations of ethnic minorities. Hostility towards sexual relations between black men and white women.
- Debate about General Dyer and the Amritsar Massacre: Morning Post campaign in favour of Dyer raised £26,000 for him 
- Continuing popularity of ‘imperial’ cultural figures such as Henty and Kipling; films with imperial themes; popularity of Elgar (Pageant of Empire, 1924)  
- Continued use of imperial themes in advertising 
- Continuing connections with migrants to settler colonies or colonial/ armed services → growing awareness of empire  
- Continuing and widespread celebration of Empire Day
