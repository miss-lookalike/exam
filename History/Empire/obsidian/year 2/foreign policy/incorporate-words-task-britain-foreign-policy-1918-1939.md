Treaty of Versailles, LoN, disarmament, Manchuria, Abyssinia, Adolf Hitler. Appeasement, Nazi-Soviet Pact

The Treaty of Versailles was the post war peace treaty signed with Germany that militarily limited them, it was considered a Diktat. The League of Nations existed as a precursor to the United Nations and did not include several powers and was dominated by British and French interests. Disarmament was a policy imposed on the Germans and other countries. Manchuria an area in North Eastern China that was invaded by Japan in 1931 following the Mukden Bridge incident. Abyssinia was invaded by Mussolini in 1936 during the distraction of the Rhineland, shows how useless the LoN is. Adolf Hitler was the Nazi Dictator of the German Third Reich and came to power in 1933. Appeasement was the policy of Neville Chamberlain that sought to maintain peace with Hitler by giving up further and further concessions. The Nazi-Soviet pact was an agreement to split Poland.
