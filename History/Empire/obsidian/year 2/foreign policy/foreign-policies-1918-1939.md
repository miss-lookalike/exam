###### First policy - appeasement:

Appeasement is the word which would define Neville Chamberlain's premiership despite his domestic policy focus. Policy of making concessions to try and retain peace - e.g. Munich conference in 1938 gives Hitler the Sudetenland. 

###### Second policy - rearmament

By 1935 (Monday 4th March, 1935 - Guardian article) the British had begun to rearm their army despite previous policy.

'Steel not Flesh' - the idea of investing further in the development of technology and machines rather than on large manpower to avoid the slaughter of people. 

- Difficulties of balancing the budget with defence commitments throughout the world – home defence was prioritised as the threat from Germany seemed to grow, development of the RAF prioritised in particular
	- Home defence heavily invested in as well as the RAF, radar and the spitfire
- Strategic overstretch – threats in the Far East (Japan), the Mediterranean (Italy) and in home waters (Germany)  
- £25 million on strengthening Singapore naval base, constructed between 1923 and 1937 – it was believed to be a fortress but limited in its effectiveness
- Rearmament:  
	- In 1938 Britain produced 7,940 aircraft compared to Germany’s 8,295 and America’s 2,195 – Hurricanes and Spitfires + long-range bombers + Radar

###### Alliance with France:

Very close military and diplomatic ties to France that gave Britain a further sense of security.
