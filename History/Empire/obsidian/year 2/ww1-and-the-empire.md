### Initial ideas:

**How might the Empire help Britain in the First World War?**

- Significant additional manpower (India + dominion volunteers - identify as British)
- Geography - spread of the empire enables global operations 
- Economic - trade + military production / resources
- Naval dominance - bases worldwide

**How might the war put stresses upon the Empire?**

- Military + financial overstretch - colonies are often not self sustaining
- Trade with empire + USA hindered due to German U-Boats -> damage to British economy
- Geographical overstretch -> difficult to defend everywhere
- Increase in national consciousness around the empire -> 'why are we fighting'

Was WW1 a European war, a war between global empires or a war fought in global empires? In some ways all 3. 

| British Empire              | Germany Empire         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| French Empire               | Austria Hungary Empire |
| Russian Empire              | Ottoman Empire         |
| Japan                       |                        |
| Italian Empjire (from 1915) |                        |
| USA (from 1917)             |                        |
|                             |                        |

Mostly global empires with a metropole in Europe - all but Japan and USA. Clashing empires and clashing global powers.

##### How did the empire help Britain in the First World war?

Look at [[imperial view of ww1]] for details of troops from dominions. 

- 415,000 from Australia
- 1,400,000 from India
- Canada 630,000
- ETC

Canada supplied Britain with half of its shrapnel by 1917, 42% of the 4.5-inch shells and 25% of 6-inch shells; 97% of Australia's meat was consumed in Britain and 35% of Britain's copper requirements was provided from there; New Zealand supplied frozen meat, wool, air produce and minerals; that 80% of the casualties and  88% of the expenditure incurred by the British Empire to defeat Germany and TÃ¼rkiye came from the United Kingdom's Treasury and domestic taxpayers.

Curzon and Milner were brought back. The dominion leaders and representatives from colonies joined the Imperial War Cabinet on 30 March 1917. Met 14 times in its first six weeks. 100,000 African workers died and 90,000 Chinese Labourers joined the Indian army. After the war Influenza travelled killing two million in India and as many as 2% of Africa.


##### What stresses did the First World War put upon the Empire?

Max Beloff and David McIntyre believe it to be a watershed moment for the independence of dominions. Ronald Hyam believed it was the start of more human policy. Expectations didn't always meet reality in terms of change.  100,000 African workers died and 90,000 Chinese Labourers joined the Indian army. After the war Influenza travelled killing two million in India and as many as 2% of Africa.
