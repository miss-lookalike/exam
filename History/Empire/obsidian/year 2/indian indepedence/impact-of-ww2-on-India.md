***

- Outrage at [[Lord-Linlithgow]]’s declaration of war in 1939 with no consultation  
	- All INC representatives resign on mass in protest of this move
	- Muslim league decide they will stay in post and cooperate with the British - trying to gain favour to get what they want from the British.
	- British initially try to keep India quiet and avoid it becoming involved in the war but the '[[strategic-abyss-darwin|strategic abyss]]' British fall into forces them to use India

- 2 million volunteer army raised  
	- Largest the army would ever get

- March 1942 – [[sir-stafford-cripps]] → promise of immediate dominion status post-war  
	- Cripps is restricted from giving India independence which is what the Indians want but not what Churchill wants.
	- Offers dominion status in exchange for cooperation during the war. 
	- India wants governance over its war effort now - Britain refuses so Cripps has achieved nothing

- August 1942 – ‘Quit India’ campaign launched (by [[nehru-and-gandhi]]) → INC leadership imprisoned  
	- Make themselves ungovernable - non-violent
	- Coercion - lock up the congress leadership, house arrest really not treated badly. Remain in prison for the rest of the war. [[Jinnah]] was not arrested as he cooperated

- 1943 - Formation of Indian National Army under Subhas Chandra Bose ([[key-figures-indian-independence#^db9f86]]) – allied with Japan  
	- various units fight alongside the Japanese but militarily they lack any significance
	- sign of weakness and splits in the nationalist movement. also sign of radicalisation

- 1943 – Bengal Famine (2-3 million dead)  
	- Bay of Bengal weather cause mass crop failure.
	- Cannot import food from Burma as Burma is occupied by the Japanese.
	- Food and infrastructure is targeted towards troops. 
	- [[Lord-Linlithgow]] fails to move food around quickly enough to help people

- 1944 – Battles of Imphal and Kohima turn the tide against Japan 
	- Furthest Japanese gets.
	- Force led by General William Slim that was made of British, British Indian and other groups. 

- Divisions between Muslim League and INC  

- India no longer a major market for British goods – trade deficit with India by 1945. By 1945 Britain owed India £1,375 million.  
	- Guaranteed market is now gone.

- Indianisation of Indian government: only 500 British civil servants and 500 British police officers by 1946

- 1945-6 Simla conference:
	- chaired by [[lord-wavell]]
	- negotiated between British, INC, Muslim League
		- INC - Unitary state, 1 person 1 vote, strong centre
		- Muslim League - separate/reserved Muslim representation, weak central government **OR** separate state (Pakistan)
		- British - dominion allied to Britain (Cold War), preferred strong state **OR** federal solution, princely states? (wanted British rule)
