***

- 1947 – [[lord-mountbatten|Lord Mountbatten]] appointed as final Viceroy. Deadline: June 1948  
	- [[lord-mountbatten|Lord Mountbatten]]'s wife having an affair with [[nehru-and-gandhi|Nehru]]
	- [[Jinnah]] was a cold, buttoned up figure unlike Nehru. Jinnah saw Mountbatten coming closer to Nehru.

- Worsening communal violence → decision on early partition rather than a federal or unitary solution 

- Independence moved to 15 August 1947 – dominion status for each within the Commonwealth  
	- 18 months -> 5 months
	- [[lord-mountbatten|Lord Mountbatten]], [[nehru-and-gandhi|Nehru]] and [[Jinnah]] all sat around a negotiating table.
	- [[lord-mountbatten|Lord Mountbatten]] accepts partition and so does Nehru.

- Widespread violence, especially in the Punjab → creation of India and Pakistan  
	- Where would the line be?
	- Majority Muslim - Pakistan, Majority Hindu - India
	- Closely balanced states of Punjab and Bengal (huge and tensely balanced)
	- [[lord-mountbatten|Lord Mountbatten]] calls up [[sir-cyril-radcliffe|Sir Cyril Radcliffe]] to try and form the border. He has never been to India before this, has to use outdated census data and has no ability to visit all these places.
	- People on the ground try to shape the demographics by kicking people out. 
	- Partition was not announced until the day after independence.

>[!Nehru Speech after partition]
>Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance

- Issues with partition
	- Pakistan in two bits - East Pakistan (half of Bengal) and West Pakistan
	- Pakistan has overly large army
	- Lahor in Pakistan despite being part of India for centuries
	- India gets a more obvious shape and the capital Delhi 


- Princely states forced to choose between new states 
	- Vast majority choose based on their religious majority

- Kashmir disputed between India and Pakistan  
	- Muslim majority but Hindu leader - upon independence both still dispute it
	- Flareups still constantly happen over Kashmir
- Hyderabad annexed by India, 1948
	- Tries to take the third option - it is about the size of England and ruled by the Nizam 
	- [[nehru-and-gandhi|Nehru]] will not tolerate it, first thing India's independent army does is s invade Hyderabad

- Initially George VI is still the king of India and Pakistan. [[lord-mountbatten|Mountbatten]] remains governor general of India, [[Jinnah]] governor general within Pakistan.
	- 1949 – India becomes a republic but remains within the Commonwealth. You can be a republic within the commonwealth, Pakistan keeps the monarchy into the 1950s.
