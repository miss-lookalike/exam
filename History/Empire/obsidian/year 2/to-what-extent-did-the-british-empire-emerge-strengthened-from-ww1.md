##### Twin dangers:

Ideas sprung from WW1:

- - **Wilsonian idealism -** 
	- Woodrow Wilson, President of the USA
	- 14 points for peace conference -> 'national self-determination' (especially Europe - dismantle empires e.g. Austria-Hungary, Germany and Ottoman)
	- Self-determination is becoming an international ideal (an aspiration) -> this threatens the status of the British empire
	- Also sought to setup the League of Nations - international peacekeeping and humanitarian body
	- Other standards will now be set that the British are set to adhere to instead of Britain doing their own thing and being a "global police force"
- - **Bolshevism[^1] -** 
	- Russian revolutionary communism
	- October Revolution, 1917. Led by Vladimir Lenin who wrote *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism*
	- Expansionist - establishing Cominterm (Communist international) in 1919 - to encourage global revolution
	- A new great game? Historical worries about Russian expansion into India through Afghanistan

##### Peace settlement - Versailles settlement (1919)

- Dismantling the empires of defeated powers
	- in Europe - 'national self-determination' [[wilsonian-idealism]] e.g. Poland, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia
	- colonial / overseas empires - [[mandate-system]] 

Due to mandate system:
- British empire ended up with 1.8 million square miles more of territory
- 13 million people added too

| Expansion of territory (1.8 million miles + 13 million people)               | Huge economic costs (c. 35 billion = 13x costs of Boer War) + disruption to trade and investments; over $4 billion borrowed from USA |
