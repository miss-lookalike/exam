>[!Dominions]
Irish Free State, Canada, Australia, NZ, South Africa, Newfoundland


A dominion was any of several largely self-governing countries of the British Empire. Progressing from colonies, their degrees of colonial self-governance increased unevenly over the late 19th century through the 1930s. 

Canada, Australia, NZ and South Africa are known as the White Settler colonies. The political community is dominated by white settlers so they have a large degree of self governance. Do they have self governance in all areas or just domestic? This was partially answered in the [[1922-chanak-crisis]] where dominions started to assert their dominance of foreign affairs. A challenge was brought to the closeness of [[dominion-links-britain|links]] between Britain and the dominions.

>Australia and the other dominions were becoming increasingly aware of the political and strategic value of the imperial connection. So too was Britain which, since the mid-1870s, was endeavouring to survive in a mutable and none too friendly world. As she entered into competition with hostile powers whose strength matched her own, it became imperative for Britain to cultivate colonial goodwill. The colonies were becoming valuable assets, since their assistance might prove vital in the event of conflict with France and Russia. Shifts in the global balance of power generated anxieties within the dominions, which had for the first time to come to terms with their own isolation and vulnerability. The possibility of an Anglo-Russian war in 1877-8, and with it seaborne raids by Russian warships on the Pacific coastlines of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, made the governments of each appreciate the extent of their dependence upon the Royal Navy.  

Increasing understanding between Britain and these settler colonies that they needed each other to survive in a more dangerous world. Britain relies on these economically whereas the dominions rely on the British navy and the British need them for troops in wars like World War One.
