1890-1914 - debate over whether public were interested in empire

MacKenzie - 'Propaganda + Empire' (1984) - the public was supportive of / interested in empire - the weight of propaganda had a big impact

Porter - 'The Absent-Minded Imperialists' (2004) - the British were apathetic about / ignorant of the empire - the propaganda is a sign that imperialists were concerned about this

### Porter - 'What did they know about empire?'

> The empire could have impacted on Britons without their really noticing it, let alone enthusing over it. Surprisingly, to a great extent this seems to have been the case.

> Not a single 'canonical' novel of the nineteenth century features the Empire significantly. The same applies to all the other arts.

> Why do nineteenth-century boys' adventure stories before G.A. Henty, for example, also avoid the British Empire so Deliberately? Could it be because the lower classes were not particularly interested in it either?

### Summary

#### Main argument:

- British people were largely ignorant of the empire as it did not appear in depictions of daily life -> unlike the French
- "Patriotism was considered dangerous". - associated with radical ideas like 'citizenship' 
	- British were 'subjects' not citizens until 1983
	- class and the class system were taught instead
- Not the people's empire -> empire only belonged to a small handful of people
	- reluctance from imperialists to label it as such -> lack of enthusiasm from working / middle classes 
- Imperialist propaganda after growing nationalism in colonies, European threat, Boer war scare (1899)

#### Evidence:

1. 'A school history of England' (1911) - Fletcher and Kipling
	- "notoriously imperialistic" - widely derided in its own time, one critic remarked "almost too bad to be true"
2. The Times, 1880: upper class fears of broader education for the masses = "is it going to turn the heads of the plough boys and make them look down on their destined walk in life?"
	- Education not officially promoted - 19th century it was kept from 80% of English population
3. Sugar = half-holiday (empire day); games and camping (scouting); funfairs (exhibitions); imperial children stories (adventurous and daring); the times ('musical imperialism')
	- only a small number of music hall songs (even during Boer war) were unambiguously pro imperial
4. 1948 - first systematic government survey - revealed ignorance and lack of commitment to colonies even then
5. Kipling one of few 19th century authors actively featuring the Empire in a significant manner
	- none of the canonical novels of the time actively featured the British empire
	- same applies for other art forms
	- The exotic found in the English middle ages and not the colonised east
	- 1904 - JR Seddon and EB Lamb designed the imperial monumental hall and tower to dwarf [[parliament]] and Westminster abbey but they were never built.
