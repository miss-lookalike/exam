- These were significant shifts in attitudes, which at least in part were also responses to events in the empire:
	- The Great Rebellion had been a massive blow to British confidence in its imperial mission in South Asia. Fifty years later the Duke of Argyll could still recall 'how sick we felt with anxiety, how alarming the prospect appeared, and how all our flowers had lost their glory', on first hearing the news of the uprising. The most lasting change in attitudes that resulted was a growing hostility to South Asians, where the earlier stereotype of the 'mild Hindu' was replaced by a belief in his deceptiveness and cruelty. As the first post-Mutiny Viceroy, Lord Canning, put it, 'the sympathy which Englishmen... felt for the natives has changed to a general feeling of repugnance'. 
	- There were similar changes in attitudes to parts of the settlement empire. During the 1860s the earlier localized conflicts between the settlers and the Maori in New Zealand escalated into full-scale land wars on North Island, as 18,000 British troops, sup- ported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled 4,000 Maori warriors. The Maori successfully resorted to guerrilla tactics, but the British eventually won thanks to their superior numbers and weaponry, and large areas of land were confiscated from the Maori as punishment for their rebellion. But once again, the natives were 'misbehaving', and as a result of these long and costly conflicts, relations between New Zealand settlers and the United Kingdom became for a time so embittered that by 1869 the New Zealand Herald was openly expressing the view that it would have been better if France rather than Britain had been the first European power to plant its flag on the islands.

- Shift from 'progressive' attempts to spread European 'civilisation' (early 19th century) + Christian emphasis on common humanity (abolitionism) 
- Shifts towards hardened concept of racial hierarchy - 'scientific racism' ([[social-darwinism]]) - inequalities are fixed (late 19th century)
- In the name of progress 19th century Europe becomes more racist
