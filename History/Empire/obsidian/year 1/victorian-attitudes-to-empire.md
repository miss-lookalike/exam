# Developments within Britain - [[l6-empire-book-annotation#162]]

- Increased literacy (esp. after 1870 Education Act) → newspapers 
- Extension of the franchise, [[extension-of-the-franchise-1867-or-second-reform-act]] + 1884 – the birth of modern political campaigning
- The growth in press coverage of imperial issues – speed of communications (telegraphy) 
	- Telegraphs and newspapers becoming more common and popular
- The development of racial ideas – ideas of ‘[[social-darwinism]]’ – replacement of earlier ideas which saw Britain as raising up ‘savages’ to the level of ‘civilisation’ (i.e. the view of missionaries and those who had campaigned against slavery) 
	- Evolution through natural selection - 'survival of the fittest'
	- Pseudo-science - e.g. phrenology - 'Social Darwinism'
		- Emphasis on race
	- Comes from people looking at European technology - people presumed Europeans must be racially superior 
	- Justifies Europeans being in charge
- Increasing association of the monarchy with the empire (Empress of India, 1877) 
- Changing ethos of British institutions: public schools, universities, churches, armed forces etc.

Case studies - [[l6-empire-book-annotation]] - page 163-164

What do these two case studies reveal about public attitudes to empire and foreign policy  
in later 19th century Britain? 

Public opinion was divided such as in the Jamaica Rebellion of 1865. Many firmly supported strong crushing of Rebellion whereas many thought it was unjust and took a humanitarian side against people like Governor Eyre. Lots of [[jingoism]]. Public opinion also could change such as with the Eastern Crisis. [[Disraeli]] won people over but they were soon taken back against these actions by the successful campaigning of [[gladstone]] in the [[midlothian-campaign-1878-1880]] which led to [[DIsraeli]]'s loss at the 1880 election.
