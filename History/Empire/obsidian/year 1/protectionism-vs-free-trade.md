#### Protectionism vs Free Trade - 1906
###### Summary 

Bad:

- Britain's economy growing more slowly than its rivals - overtaken in share of global manufacturing by the USA and Germany
- Greater competition and growing [[protectionism]] from rivals

Good:

- Yet, Britain's still doing more trade with non-imperial markets than imperial markets
- Britain's share of '[[invisibles]]' and its overseas investments kept Britain's economy buoyant

###### Argument

Free Trade - Why?:  
- Better for consumers (lower prices)  
- The source of Britain’s strength in the past  
- More trade with non-imperial markets  

Tariff Reform/ Imperial Preference (Protectionism) - Why?: 
- Protect British businesses from ‘unfair’ foreign competition  
- Promote unity in the empire, potentially laying the groundwork for an Imperial Federation (thus also solving the Irish Question) - Chamberlain is highly interested in this and wants the Empire to be something like the USA 
- Raise government income from tariffs for social reform  
	- Chamberlain wanted a system of state pension
	- Solve poverty - avoid socialism

---
###### Effects

 - Conservatives become divided over this -> landslide defeat of Conservatives in 1906 election
 - Colonies are not keen 
 - Imperial Preference rejected in 1906 election
	 - 'Hands of the people's bread'

---
###### The result: 

Imperial Preference rejected by 1902 Colonial Conference by Dominion leaders + landslide defeat of Conservatives in 1906 election -> Dominions start creating their own customs policies

#### Protectionism vs Free Trade - 1918-1939

Free Trade -
- Who benefits?
	- Consumers - lower prices, more competition
	- Foreign producers and competitive producers in Britain
- Who loses?
	- Producers within Britain or the empire who are uncompetitive - employees whose jobs are not well protected
	- The government - less income
	

Protectionism
- Who benefits?
	- British business owners (and thus business employees) - protected from foreign competition
	- Government receives income from tariffs
	- Imperial preference - encourages unity in the empire
- Who loses?
	- The consumer - higher prices
	- Foreign producers
