# 1.Why was Ireland's status within the United Kingdom problematic? 

- Act of Union 1880
- Irish were often peasants and British were rich

# 2.Why did Ireland complicate British party politics in the House of Commons? 

- Changed the Liberal Party fundamentally
	- Lost most of its aristocratic wing
	- Lost one of its most able radicals in Joseph Chamberlain
		- Along with this came the lost of seats in the West Midlands 
	- Liberal support was lost in south Lancashire and north Cheshire.
		- Areas with high levels of Catholic Irish immigration.
		- As a result, the anti-Irish vote went to the Conservatives
	- Irish Liberal Party failed to gain any seats after 1886

- Loss of the Whigs would lead to a more radical Liberal party
	- In 1891, the Liberal Party produced its Newcastle Programme, this was a party programme including a list of radical reforms. Including Home rule, reform of the drinking laws, reform of education and land reform.

- Faddists and more splits 
	- Faddists still had divisions
		- Liberal supports who championed a particular single issue
		- E.g. These included the UK alliance
	- A more fundamental division occurred between Liberals who supported the defence of empire, the Liberal Imperialists ('Limps') and radicals
		- Radicals became known as pro-Boers due to their condemnation of British policy during the war

- Conservatives became anti home rule after 1886
	- Lord Randolph Churchill visited Belfast. 
		- Northeast Ireland was mostly against home rule as it feared the religious majority of the South - Prod vs Catholic 
		- Home = Rome
	- From 1886 links between Ulster and and the Conservatives grew
		- Strengthened even further when Andrew Bonar Law became Conservative leader
		- 1912-1914 led a campaign with Sir Edward Carson against Home Rule
		- The Conservatives almost brought Britain close to civil war in Ireland by August 1914.
			- Only the first world war prevented this
	- Benefited electorally 
		- 1886-1892 - 96 Liberal Unionists supported COnservatives
		- 1895 they merged to form the Unionist Party
		- Were called the unionists until 1922
	- Confirmed [[Conservative party]] as patriotic and imperialist
		- Follows on from [[disraeli]]
		- Did well in port and garrison towns

- 1887 Parnellite antics caused the government of Lord Salisbury ([[salisbury-convention]]) to introduce the Guillotine or Gag
	- Decides a time limit on debate before a vote of a bill stopping time wasting 
	- Liberals used to pass their second home rule bill in 1893

- Changing of Parliament
	- Only two days were allocated to government 
		- But by 1880s and 1890s the majority of days were dominated by [[minister]] pushing [[backbencher]] aside 
	- Forming of modern [[whips]] to keep MPs in order and guarantee attendance 
		- 1871 - 38% votes follow a two party structure 
		- 1894 - 84%
	- Frontbenchers were becoming more radical not backbenchers more moderate

- Emergence of class language in politics
	- Gladstone accusing Conservatives of being class motivated
	- 1884 - Fabian Society
	- 1893 - Independent Labour Party 
	- Unions coming about
	- Class becoming more important

# 3.How did successive British governments try to deal with Ireland until 1886? 

- 1868-74 under Gladstone failed to deliver the desired land and education reforms
	- Led to 1873 establishment of Home Rule Party under Isaac Butt. 59 MPs at the 1874 general election
	- 1877 under Charles Stewart Parnell obstructed parliament as much as possible
		- Endless speeches and votes

- Gladstone 1880-1885
	- pursued conciliation (some land reforms) with coercion; but this failed to have the desired effect of undermining support for Home Rule.
	- After the third Reform Act of 1884 (introducing household suffrage for the counties), trebled the Irish electorate. Parnell and his followers were able to strengthen their grip in Ireland winning 85 out of 103 seats in 1885.

# 4.What position did Gladstone end up taking on Ireland from 1886 onwards? 

- Supporting home rule
- Announced in December 1885 issue of *The Leeds Mercury* which was a liberal newspaper
